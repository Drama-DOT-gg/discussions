I'm not talking services themselves but the CEO - \"Kasper\" is shady as fuck and I will provide some more proof to this claim as I proceed through this thread.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly until a few days ago they used to claim on their website that they were a non profit organization and were basically committing tax fraud by accepting donations and payments for SiteFold, hostwithgorilla, I understand that these donations and payments may be required to run the basic infra but why promote yourself as a non profit then? You can still find the google search results of them claiming that they were a non profit as you can see in the below screenshots</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387021-531509-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629386981-859433-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I'm going to attach a few screenshots of conversation from the Blesta and r/webhosting Discord server as that basically explains most of the things that I meant to bring to all of Drama.gg visitor's attention and leave it up to your judgement. Oh and you can also see the extremely unprofessional behavior of the CEO in the professional conversations.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387273-915950-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387295-268980-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387313-113069-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387331-199277-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387343-340837-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387365-529265-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>ah yes, your friend has spoken to his lawyer and confirmed its allowed.

offers support only for 4 hours, while almost all providers in the industry offer 24/7 so literally no reason to choose them as their privacy claims aren't validated and their support is for 4 hrs per day.</p>","editedAt":"2021-08-19T17:54:24+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"899"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4215"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4215"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"24765","attributes":{"number":3,"createdAt":"2021-08-19T16:26:12+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><img

choose services offered by Kasper whether be it on Swivro, Sitefold.co or hostwithgorilla.com as they used stolen/servers without paying for them/got for free by some other person with no guarantee (I don't know if this is still the case now but you can see screenshots of his conversations below)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629389161-242104-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nThis was when Kasper used to run a Git client called GitPear as a part of Swivro on a VPS provided by <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Jen\" class=\"UserMention\">@Jen</a> and this happened</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629389198-538030-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>He influenced some other teenager too into believing all his claims and

Kasper himself would be interested.<br>\nFinal verdict: Do not trust any service that CEO of Swivro, SiteFold.co and HostWithGorilla.com a.k.a \"Kasper\" runs.</p>","editedAt":"2021-08-19T17:56:19+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"899"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4215"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4215"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"24768"},{"type":"posts","id":"24769"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"24768","attributes":{"number":5,"createdAt":"2021-08-19T16:51:30+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a

href=\"https://drama.gg/d/899/18\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"24812\">exelen</a> Hi, this was when I was first starting out Swivro (the freepik logo). I needed a logo to complete my website which at the time used WordPress. You have to understand, unlike most people on this forum, I'm not a child and I don't have unlimited free time. I have stuff to do &amp; places to be, I can't sit around for hours on hours &amp; days straight making my own logo, coding my entire website, etc, on a computer. I'm sorry to hear that you're not happy with my website.<br>\nIn regards to what you said above, yes, I did change stuff on my website after screenshots were taken. I took the rather <em>harsh</em> advice and changed my website accordingly. Additionally, In no way am I evading taxes under any circumstance. I made that text larger on the Sitefold website as it appears you were not happy with it. If you have any more suggestions, I'm always open to hear them, but if you are going to give me suggestions in an impudent way, I won't appreciate that very much.</p>\n\n\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4223"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"899"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"24818","attributes":{"number":19,"createdAt":"2021-08-20T00:20:24+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":" <p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-20/1629418811-937709-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nhere it is!</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"899"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3126"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"25010","attributes":{"number":25,"createdAt":"2021-08-20T03:07:19+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/899/21\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25000\">anonymous321</a> I can list lots of things that you did, but I am too nice to do so.

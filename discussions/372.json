a sense of humor, was nice and helpful. When I first ordered from him thats when problems started. It did not want to activate the service due to \"cpanel provider\" having downtime (see image above). After my service was activated it had much downtime and it was VERY VERY VERY slow. Files started dissapearing, the system kept crashing, account creation was unusable. After all that the server just died and he had to reinstall it (all data was lost). We went quiet after the service expired. I decided to order a dedi from him (8 euros at the time) and it all went fine. 1 day before it should have expired the server magically was wiped and he denied any responsibility for anything. When i ordered the dedi directly from OneProvider (was 6 euro at the time) he told me he would give me full billingfox support but when i asked him for basic help setting up his response would always be \"The server is not in my account so i can't help you\" then he would proceed to ignore me for the rest of the day. Recently he opened a \"bank\" (anyone smells money laundery?). Imagine trusting that guy with your money when he can't even run a stable webserver. :joy:</p>\n\n<p>Hope he gets exposed for all his bullshit.</p>\n\n\n<p>EDIT:<br>\nForgot to add some important stuff!<br>\nUses cheapest business addy from registeraddress.co.uk: <a href=\"https://ngx.has-your-fard-card.xyz/HJ5ldxmQncr98Csm\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ngx.has-your-fard-card.xyz/HJ5ldxmQncr98Csm</a></p>\n\n<p>After i said billingfox is buggy he blocked me and deleted all my services.</p>","editedAt":"2021-04-14T10:19:38+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"372"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3039"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3039"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"2962"},{"type":"users","id":"3179"},{"type":"users","id":"3341"},{"type":"users","id":"3385"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"10895"},{"type":"posts","id":"21474"}]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"320"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"323"}]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"10895","attributes":{"number":4,"createdAt":"2021-04-14T10:07:58+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/372/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"10890\">Abooz</a> by bank you mean take your money and give it to him if yes hellllll no</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2962"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"372"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3039"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"10896"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"21474","attributes":{"number":53,"createdAt":"2021-07-13T08:36:48+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/372/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"10890\">Abooz</a> None of your images link is working, please update</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3859"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"372"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"10891","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-04-14T09:56:51+00:00","contentType":"discussionRenamed","content":["ThosHost, ThosBank, BillingFox Bad/Illegal services","ThosHost, ThosBank, BillingFox Bad/Illegal services & Cracked software"],"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"372"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3039"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"10894","attributes":{"number":3,"createdAt":"2021-04-14T10:03:29+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>This is true</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"372"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3341"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3039"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"10896","attributes":{"number":5,"createdAt":"2021-04-14T10:08:30+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/372/4\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"10895\">ShemBane</a> yes ofc</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3039"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"372"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"10898","attributes":{"number":6,"createdAt":"2021-04-14T10:14:06+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>I had the same, with this dude, when I first bought the reselling service I thought it will never crash, how there were good reviews on youtube and trustpilot.

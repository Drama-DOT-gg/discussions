Today I would like to show you all some info about listed.host, a few months old host that should be about to \"re-release\". I would like to talk about the unprofessionalism of this hosting provider. They have been promising multiple times to re-launch, for then just pinging everyone and saying that theyâ€™re sorry. One of the owners, Xcyth, just keeps confirming that he is a full stack dev and more cool things, but at the same time WHOOPS! He just completely wiped an entire dedicated server with users data! And he obviously says that there wasnâ€™t much data on it anyways, yeah just like saying who caresâ€¦<br>\nThis data loss affected me and I donâ€™t want you guys to be one of the future victims of this host: WATCH OUT!<br>\nSo yeah, after this happened they have been promising to re-launch for months, without doing anything. I remember that they had a bot, but for some reason Xcyth decided to ditch it and make one (and after 3 months itâ€™s not ready yet, what a slow full stack developerâ€¦.)<br>\nHere is all the proof you guys need, have a wonderful day!<br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/B411ZtN.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/piBCwTU.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/URFHBQR.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nwtm81J.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1250"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4961"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"36436","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-11-30T06:40:52+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>This is not unprofessionalism.

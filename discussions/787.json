I was then asked 'how much is tax' (screenshot provided). For a host charging sales tax to not know the percentage, yeah that's a massive red flag. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925023-932657-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Proxala (inc)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Upon receiving my stripe link to pay Proxala, the email and my bank statement both said Proxala Inc, as shown here<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925137-369233-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"> and here <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925189-353787-image0.png\" title=\"\">. When i questioned Aspect (The owner of Proxala) about this, he blamed my bank and said that it was lying. [upl-image-preview <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925264-274401-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Unsecure Dedicated Servers + False Suspension</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once my server was delivered, it was set with an extremely unsecure root password (12345678), and i was not told to change it. Obviously, we should have, but i was more concerned with checking ipmi to make sure the server is legitimate, etc, and gave the infomation to my technician to install virtulizor on it. <br>\nI awoke at around 3am my time today, to find out that my service had been suspended at 1am today, due to the cpu being maxed for 4h, which firstly id like to point out that its a dedicated server and why was he looking at my server files (he stated he kvmed in), and secondly the fact that he tried to keep it frozen and not issue a refund is questionable. I went back to sleep.</p> \n\n<p>Additionally, his method of suspending my server is questionable, his suspension method was to unplug the server, rather than disconnecting network, or a safe power down. This suspension method is incredibly alarming, due to the fact that if i was transferring files, or something, it could potentially corrupt something.</p> \n\n<p>I further probed him on this around 12pm today ish and was told to email in to request a login (i had forgotten he sent the new login via discord due to my tiredness this morning). I emailed in with the following '''Hi bitch give me my login info k ty', not exactly professional, but expresses my frustration at his refusal to reset the password because i asked him on discord, even though I had ordered, and paid via a stripe link on discord. He then stated he had disabled the server again, no reason was provided. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925651-743385-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Refusing Refunds</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aspect stated that i had been refunded for this service<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925800-863011-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\n, however after further probing, he revealed that a refund has not been issued, and that he wanted me to make a ticket on his billing panel<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925807-777879-capture1.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nWhich i dont think i even have a login for, i dont know my password, and frankly i dont want to go onto his site.</p> \n\n<p><strong>Overall Shady Services</strong></p>\n\n<p>The IPs provided for this server are shown as Verizon Residential IPs</p>\n\n<p>(68.132.35.101<br>\n68.132.35.102<br>\n68.132.35.103<br>\n68.132.35.104<br>\n68.132.35.105)<br>\nHowever, he states that they are DC IPs, and it is 'wrong', which i heavily doubt, he has not provided proof of having any Rackspace in the location the server was delivered to me in (NY), and the ips all match up to be Verizion ips, the only proof of him having Rackspace was a picture of a genetic ass looking rack, with 10 year old storage servers in.</p> ","editedAt":"2021-07-10T14:13:43+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"787"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2943"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2943"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"21237","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-10T14:19:12+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/730023081489203241/863389324266176533/Captura_de_ecran_din_2021-07-10_la_15.00.50.png?width=1644&amp;height=1028\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Proxola using photo's from Eurovision for their landing header</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"787"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"711"}]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"21240","attributes":{"number":3,"createdAt":"2021-07-10T14:40:31+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Dear customer,</p>\n\n<p>We've disabled your dedicated server in the first place for a consistent CPU usage of 100% for more then 4 hours, whilst you were \"claiming\" you were asleep. You could reply in the other discords where you were in tho. We've disabled your contact with us due to that email, and multiple refusals to go to your clientarea to make support requests. We do not feel like Discord is a perfect place to share those kinds of details on, and are working hard on our clientarea to make it a easy experience for the user. The excuses you gave for not wanting to go to our clientarea to make support requests were actually very bad: \"I dont want to leak the static ip of my wework office\" and \"i dont feel like it\". No, if you want us to refund or be official whilst saying \"we're going to sue you\" but wanting to handle things via discord is not the case in here. We do colocate with FirstLight (NET) with their FIOS network, and that's why the IPs might be showing up as residential. We're moving away soon to a Corespace Datacenter in New York with a own asn and more network capacity as Verizon simply doesn't offer us enough space to grow. We did not refuse your refund, we only asked you to make a ticket for it in our clientarea, what you did actually refuse a few times. We also changed our passwords to be more secure in the future, and we are active working on new automatic provisioning with so automatic passwords and management to make it more easier for our customers. We also decided to remove the possible copyrighted hero banner from our website. The fact that you can never be professional, screaming at other hosts / kids / people that they are bad whilst you can't even pay your own customers their refunds and employee's is a big thing to say so. We also shouldn't be called poor whilst having working owned hardware who can reach to it's max capacity not speaking about the facts that your RAM failed. We're disappointed with the service you might have experienced from us, and we're always searching for a solution. About our registration with Stripe, this has been resolved and \"Inc.\" is removed from our creditcard statements until further notice. If you would like your refund to be made please create a ticket or e-mail us at <a href=\"mailto:support@proxala.io\">support@proxala.io</a> / <a href=\"mailto:hello@proxala.io\">hello@proxala.io</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\nAspect</p>","editedAt":"2021-07-10T14:42:13+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"787"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3943"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3943"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"21241"},{"type":"posts","id":"21243"}]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"697"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"698"}]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"21241","attributes":{"number":4,"createdAt":"2021-07-10T14:48:18+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/787/3\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"21240\">Aspect</a></p> \n\n<p>'claiming' I was asleep?</p>\n\n<p>No, i was asleep.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, ive already sent you multiple refund requests, that you ignored. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625928496-375407-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2943"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"787"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"21242"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"21243","attributes":{"number":6,"createdAt":"2021-07-10T14:52:37+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/787/3\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"21240\">Aspect</a> you were \"claiming\" you were asleep.

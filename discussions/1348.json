This person does not think of consequences and still confirms himself as \"not underaged\".  I have a few images just to show you how annoying he can get.</p>\n\n<p>First image:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-31/1640961886-201386-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Man keeps on telling me and like 6 other people to stop playing the game so he can farm points for himself. He's done it several times and it's getting on everyone's nerves.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-31/1640961975-507978-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>This one. Whenever he's stuck on a word, he pings the people who might actually know what it is. Everyone's always busy in life and in Discord, you can't just expect everyone to help you out. And when we answer for him...</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-31/1640962090-258334-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Yep. He gets to rant like a kid. I've actually made an explanation on more of this shit in one of the staff members' DMs.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-31/1640962191-338173-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>But I've also just gotten aware of his... other stuff. (haha cry about it, more images incoming)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-31/1640962272-730271-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-31/1640962306-910983-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-31/1640962360-725407-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>These next few images are from some kind of server named \"Pangea\". I heard they used to maintain this bot named \"Jurrasic Bot\" before it got offline. While the staff members aren't there anymore (and the owner having a deleted account), Silverer starts to perform the funny...</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-31/1640962498-666736-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-31/1640962882-261938-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>I asked him on why he did these. He responded with \"it's just funny, people don't get pinged and I can still do it repetitively\"; he's not fucking serious. I can't believe he doesn't even know that he:</p>\n\n<ul><li>still pings a lot of other people in middle of those defective ping message</li>\n<li>spams</li>\n<li>doesn't care</li></ul>\n  <br>\n<p>Here was another one right after he was banned from some game, server, and like 3 bots:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-31/1640962846-211335-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Looks too funny for me to not include lol. He started off nice when joining that one server I was in, but he slowly started to show his true colors. What a bitch lmao</p>\n\n<p>About like 6 people already tried to report him to Discord, but to no avail. Man's insane.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1348"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4684"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"39181","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-12-31T17:12:30+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Not

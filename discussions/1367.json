delete the server files, blame it on me then get rid of my roles (Had Ownership at the time on discord) and added the owner of galactic nodes as a dev. <br>\n<img

Schaefer, the old owner, was exposed by Xylo for scamming. I, endy, would like to say I am no way affiliated with these raiding actions. Schaefer was the one involved with cracked plugins and I am currently buying a Strike Practice licence with financial help (im broke).  All im trying to do is have a fun place where people can chill man not a business operation. I admit, I am not your average server owner and really don't have time to deal with this stuff, yes I am currently in class.

Try to see if that is something a normal human will do</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Check how old their service is</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>On average</strong> the older, the better, if a host managed to survive for more than 4/5 months without any issue they are probably legit</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Ask for a free trial</p> </div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, if they offer one.

If you can pay for your node uptme and can't pay like 20 $ a year get the fuck out</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they use WHMCS? Is it nulled?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they use WHMCS, check if the theme is nulled or no. Again, if you have the money to run a node, and dont have the money to pay 20$ a month you shouldn't be running a host</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they  give invite rewards?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they do, leave them and report to discord. Please</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they hate drama.gg?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If in one of their rules they express their not happiness with d.gg they are not clear.</p> \n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they ask to pay with crypto?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they do, leave them.

If its Invalid, then you found a NULLED WHMCS license, chances of that being a scam are very likely in this case. However, WHMCS license checking can be very fucky wucky as well.

Called the thread fake and bullcrap.<br>\nThe conversation is considerably long so ill be breaking it to chunks.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639058369-49323-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nFirst screenshot, he asks me in DMs why I took him onto drama.gg, and that I did not do anything at the company and did not bother at all to do work. He's gonna be extremely ironic about this later. Then he proceeds to say another staff has been paid 200+ dollars, and he states they had financial troubles at the time they hired us. Okay, first big red flag. Why would you hire employees when your company is sinking.... whaaaaat? Theres a reason why people are retrenched when crap hits the fan, like COVID hitting certain industries hard.... and here we have Floofy hiring claiming they would pay even though they are barely surviving.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639058608-141667-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nI bring this reasoning up to him, and he uses a really basic excuse. You can also note the last message, where he implies he will pay me, on the condition I take this drama.gg thread down. Basically bribery to censor the stuff.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639059018-792914-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe proceeds to add me into a group with management after that, and DIRECTLY ASKS what I want so I can take the thread down, as if the inference he did earlier was not clear enough. I give a blunt response of the facts. To give context basically he had joined MY public minecraft server, and then proceeded to pull such a dumb joke at 1am for me. He then said I could have banned him... he FULL WELL KNEW I WAS SLEEPING bruh</p>\n\n<p>Before I continue I want to note that I was kicked off the group after typing this part of the story lol, so rest of screenshots are coming from my phone since I was outside and I had taken SSes of every part of our convo. Censorship much?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639059540-230734-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nI was also asked the intentions of my thread, which I made clear. Most of the other messages are quite boring, except the last one... he said I would have gotten my pay if I had asked for it before I had left. Okay another major red flag. I was working there for months, my pay was supposed to arrive monthly anyway. Why would I have to ask for my pay? That's dumb...<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639059796-326886-screenshot-20211209-212425-discord-beta.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nHere's where he gets super ironic about my pay. He had stated earlier that I had not bothered to work, but now he was suddenly offering to pay me 50 dollars for the 3 months I actually gave the toots to work there. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639059870-725319-screenshot-20211209-212757-discord-beta.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nWe then negotiated a pay sum, hoping that we could end this somewhat peacefully and maybe i'd tone down this thread, but he insisted I took this thread down completely to get my pay. I do know that shaming an employer would piss him/her off but I made this in the first place to make people aware of floofy's shenanigans because I was not getting paid. Heck if I did not bother with this thread he would not have bothered to offer to pay me. I reasoned that ill take the part about the nonpayment down since he would pay me, but the other stuff about unprofessionalism and having poor customer service stays up since that isn't fixed.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639060316-978379-smartselect-20211209-213035-discord-beta.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe emphasizes it again.... and so do I<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639060494-684996-screenshot-20211209-213454-discord-beta.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nFirst messages, dude from management busy correcting my mistakes in the thread.... welp acting like this to 4 customers is worse than acting like this to 1 LOL. Such audacity to admit. Then he claims a reason for termination was not mentioned, and that I was bending screenshots such that abdullah would look bad. I then ask him to mention the reason I was terminated since he apparently knows a reason that was never mentioned....<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639060636-423765-screenshot-20211209-213522-discord-beta.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nlo and presto, dude from management doesn't know this reason apparently, so how does he knows this reason exists, if it is even real and not made up?... I ask.... and no good answer! <br>\nI'm extremely crude in the next screenshot because I was honestly tired that this was dragging out so long, so ill have to censor some stuff.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-09/1639061028-844099-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nmagically goes on to talk about how my evidence is fake again, literally right after I ask where he got this \"reason I was not told I was terminated for\". Yadda yadda yadda. Basically saying the same as earlier. Basically im \"bending\" screenshots to make abdullah look bad, mhm.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, after all this happened, because abdullah basically wanted to pay me my months of work in turn of me keeping quiet and taking this thread down, I ended up with nothing, but more drama from Abdullah, and Management telling me my thread is nonsensical even though ive screenshots to prove my points. Funny. Now i'm also going to be \"sued\"\" for breaking the NDA by telling the world his nodes are overallocated(welp they arent overallocated rn, but they have been set to allow overallocation by 4 or 5x to clarify.). Basically him and his management are doing anything they can to make me keep quiet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1284"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5034"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"37522"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"37522","attributes":{"number":17,"createdAt":"2021-12-09T16:01:10+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"\n<p><a

I didn't force you to do that, I just wanted you to help me pay for nodes, not forcing you to do so or something like that.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You demoted me for no reason!<br>\nYes, I did demote you, but not really. First of all, I made you management instead of executive, but then you were mad because I gave you a role a lower behind executive but with all perms except admin. I then got mad because you changed the server name in Discord to „MJCloud · Free hosting”, and then we got into a 'fight'.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You are a kid!

I'm usually calm, and not toxic, but you are making me mad like no one else. I think you should have a reward for that.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>MJCloud doesn't have ToS or PP<br>\nYes, for now of course. I'm still working on it, and working on 6 different things is hard - dashboard, node uptime, new nodes, checking drama.gg and searching for MJCloud every day, maintaining the server, and making ToS &amp; PP.

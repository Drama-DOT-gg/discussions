The license was never nulled and isn't running anymore. I made an account just to look at it. They have stated (On all platoforms) That they where shutting that hosting company down. It's not unusual for a company to leave their services running till either they are purchased by a different company or asked by a provider to take it down. A DMCA Takedown on this is overkill.</p> \n\n<p>On other note it just seems like you are here to start drama about something that was already disproven. No-where in the cancellation process does it state that you would have to take your work down.</p> \n\n<p>I could change my mind buy this company from it's respectful owners and keep the same domain / name running on a renewd license. This happens quite alot and I've done it before.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to discuss further on a civilised matter then you can find me here!<br>\n<a href=\"https://discord.com/users/871877975346405388\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Discord Profile Direct</a></p>\n\n<ul><li>Regards,<br>\n  Nicole H. <br>\n  Serena K.</li></ul>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4451"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"978"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"27632","attributes":{"number":6,"createdAt":"2021-09-11T17:32:16+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-11/1631381528-834181-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>You could've also just checked the admin page</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"978"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2846"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"27646"},{"type":"posts","id":"27726"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"27646","attributes":{"number":7,"createdAt":"2021-09-11T19:22:16+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/978/6\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27632\">Tomas</a> Ah Jerome.

I was talking to the community (375 members) and was discussing the future of SandNodes. We where preparing to launch in 2 days. Since that was the date everyone was counting down to before Milan gave me owner.<br>\nJust as I was about to buy a VPS I became sceptical and asked Milan for server owner (full ownership). He says I need to ask this rando kid. I end up with a group chat, this kid wont budge, he is clearly is manipulating Milan with threats. I was asking for owner, and he was like \"no!!11 lock host new host!1 sand node was a test!\". Total joke. He ended up wanting 30 Euro for the server. I was over it, made a new server, pinged everyone to join it and the message was deleted? I look at the group chat and this skid was threatening to leak info from Milan if he didn't delete the server. Obviously, Milan deleted it. Then, if it isn't anymore dumb, I start growing the SandNode v2 server with the old staff team, and well, well well..<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-02-17/1645108024-832134-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-02-17/1645108037-79343-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n(Defamation, We never stole anything, we took the name that the server was deleted, even though I had OWNER.)<br>\nThis whole thing is a joke, he claims 20GB of ram for free, laugh with me boys and girls!<br>\nEitherway, Don't go near LockNodes unless you want:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>abuse owner</li>\n<li>harassment</li>\n<li>threats</li>\n<li>lies<br>\nThanks for reading my thread,<br>\nKind regards,<br>\nSnail.</li> </ol>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1715"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3490"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"4956"},{"type":"users","id":"5449"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"44225"},{"type":"posts","id":"44236"},{"type":"posts","id":"44250"},{"type":"posts","id":"44251"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"44225","attributes":{"number":3,"createdAt":"2022-02-17T14:58:10+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1715/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"44223\">SnailDOS</a> i mean u did kinda steal the name for it sooo he iant lying about that tbh</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5523"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1715"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"44226"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"44236","attributes":{"number":14,"createdAt":"2022-02-17T16:44:30+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1715/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"44223\">SnailDOS</a> First of all, sandnode is trash, now locknodes?

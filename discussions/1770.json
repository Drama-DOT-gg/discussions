They don't even have a site yet and they're already operating illegally. They also do random wipes which make me believe it's when their trial ends and they have to create another node?</p>\n\n<p>I sadly couldn't create a server to check what egg they were using, as their nodes were full already, and if it was a multi-egg to blacklist them, but I've created a ticket some hours ago to ask for invoices whatsoever they didn't reply yet. I'll keep you all updated.</p>\n\n","editedAt":"2022-03-03T17:37:28+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1770"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3427"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3427"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"45294","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2022-03-04T07:20:53+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>They're still deleting my messages on general chat about their aws nodes and they still have not replied to my ticket.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1770"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3427"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"45295"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"45295","attributes":{"number":3,"createdAt":"2022-03-04T07:35:47+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1770/2\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"45294\">babyharpseal</a> ah yes, very much professionalism?

First of all I'll start by naming the host, and show where it all started.  The host is called StarNode, this hosting was rated by Ajneb himself, and he gave it a score of 0.3/10 due to its lag, bugs, errors and much more.  After this, many summaries sent thousands of criticisms, due to its poor service.  Then I am going to show you what is behind this hosting.  To create this hosting, Mr. Vainki copied from other places all the code that makes up the host, he copied the CSS code, he also copied the appearance of the pterodactyl panel among many other things.

It was because <strong>the panel's database was corrupted</strong> and we had to restart everything to fix some errors because of this. So, almost 2 months later, it's impossible to a free node to stay up THAT much time. And there wasn't any nodes change in this period. Still the same ips, even numerical ones.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to the CSS code: <strong>VyxterHost and StarNode are linked</strong> and the owners have work together, so there's no copy.</p> \n\n<p>Now this:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2018/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"48590\">Pelotudo_</a> this hosting was rated by Ajneb himself, and he gave it a score of 0.3/10 due to its lag, bugs, errors and much more.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Ajneb tested the host in a date that the host was still, not even on beta, but a pre-beta phase.

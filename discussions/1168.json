Since then, I have rarely been able to use it. I have had under 3 weeks of total uptime, and they are well aware of that.</p>\n\n<p>PLEASE NOTE: Their homepage specifies 99.9% SLA uptime.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-31/1635716683-409139-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>What happened:<br>\nOn 09/01, they talked about moving me to a new server. I said sure. Here is the full transcript since then:</p>\n\n<p>Me 9/10:  <code>How much longer will this take?</code><br>\nJames 9/15: <code>Sorry for the delay on this I have escalated this ticket we have been busy working on a  few builds.</code><br>\nMe 9/28: <code>How much longer? I really need this server.</code><br>\nMe: 10/04: <code>Can I receive a refund for the last few months? It's listed that you guys have a 99.9% SLA Uptime promise.</code><br>\n<em>At this point, I submitted a review of 2 stars</em><br>\nJames 10/7: <code>For us to give you any kind of refund or a new server to replace your current one, you will need to remove your bad review.</code><br>\n<em>Then I removed the negative review, just hoping to get a refund. I also sent that screenshot to a friend who workes there, and they said that they were quitting.</em><br>\nAnother staff member (Actually helpful) 10/10: <code>Please advise us on the Operating system you wish to have installed.</code><br>\nMe: 10/11: <code>I would like to receive a refund for the past 2 months.</code></p> \n\n<p>James 10/11: <code>We can give you this month free due to not having a running server for the month. Please tell us what OS you would like installed so we can get your server up.</code><br>\nMe 10/13: <code>Proxmox, the latest version is fine.</code><br>\nMe: 10/28: <code>Can I get it set up already?</code><br>\n<em>silence</em></p>\n\n<p>I have talked to a few staff members there, and apparently, there are only 2 people who actually have the power to help with these issues.</p>\n\n<p>I kinda hope they don't find this, as I am still trying to get this all figured out.</p> \n\n<p>Anyways, that's all I have so far. I'll keep everyone updated.</p>\n","editedAt":"2021-11-07T00:36:06+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1168"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4746"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4746"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"4746"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"33541","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-10-31T23:05:18+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>I have personally had nothing but good experiences with them.

Ayaan the owner of night host is a big scammer reported in most of the servers. He keeps on deleting his accounts to not get caught. He had a fake hosting named guitar host which was using free trials like night host and fooling people. You can refer to this for more info: <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/520-guitarhostxyz-using-free-trials-and-lying-to-their-customers\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://drama.gg/d/520-guitarhostxyz-using-free-trials-and-lying-to-their-customers</a> Now after all his plans got failed he is with a new scam, That is Night Host.</p> \n\n<p>Things You Will Face (From my experiance):<br>\n1) You will loose your bot's files and he will say that is a technical issue! Once again you get fooled. What you can do is only cry, hes not gonna give you anything back.<br>\n2) Your bots or whatever you are hosting, the files gets leaked. He has many bots which he copied from his users.<br>\n3) High risk of privacy, as he logs all your data and passwords in a discord channel. (My friend was an moderator there before) which means all your datas including your IP will be exposed.</p> \n\n<p><img

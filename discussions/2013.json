Basically what he does is hire a dedicated there because the first month they don't charge you, they charge you the following month. But when you hire them you use a card that then blocks it so that when the time comes that ionos wants to charge you they can't do it.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-22/1661129642-361125-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nTranslation of the screenshot: 0 €<br>\nThe invoice amount of 130 € will be charged after one month.</p>\n\n<p>Going back in time, this guy was using Google Cloud Free Trial for his nodes, then he started using Oracle Free Tier and is currently using ionos free dedicated server. Here is a screenshot of an ad he posted on his hosting discord, what a coincidence that the ad was posted a month after he contracted the dedicated hosting.<br>\n<img

not charge them, plus my friend reported the machines two days ago and they erased the machines, that's weird no?

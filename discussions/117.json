don't usually to this but it has come to such a point that I have to do this.<br>\nAs you know MVP who was famous for DDoSing previously is back scamming.<br>\nHe has been here since alot of time but he never scammed someone like this.<br>\nAs you all know I recently bought my-licences.uk for around 500$ BTC (Around 2.7k$ USD after P2P transaction)<br>\nThe deal was everything to be transferred to me specially the licenses system which required 150$ / month to be renewed and the whole thing made over 200$ a month easily somtimes it was even more than 400$ a month.<br>\nAfter purchasing all I have got so long is the discord server and a <strong>Shared</strong> API access to create liceneses. The deal was too that he would never start the licensing business again but there we go its broken!<br>\nI have asked him repeatedly to transfer the domain to me and give the complete account access however upto the date it had not happened. When started being strict about it he went mad and said he would give everything and let me fuck off lul<br>\nI was gone to work during that time (night shift for me). I came back home almost around 3 am and gone to sleep. When I woke up all I see is my DM's being spammed that their reseller hosting is down licenses are not working and what not. When I investigated it further I came to know that the scammer (MVP) has suspended the hosting for the domain eu0.co.uk where all files were hosted. <img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601964265-763570-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nThe cPanel server where everything was hosted had the password changed.<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601964366-422507-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nThe admin login for my-licences.uk has been changed too <img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-10-06/1601964399-512783-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nAll reseller hosting hosted on his cPanel server is down too.

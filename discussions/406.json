I've listed a few charges below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charges</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Using Freenom</li>\n<li>Using Contabo (This is not a crime, but considering the \"DDoS shield\" was claimed)</li>\n<li>Falsing Information</li>\n<li>Blackmailing</li>\n<li>Having no Legal TOS</li>\n<li>Exitscamming</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Using freenom, I'd not need to explain this to much claims to have a good host whilst using a free .cf domain from Freenom. You can get those days a .xyz for maybe 1$ at Namecheap.</p> \n\n<p>Using Contabo whilst claiming they do have premium servers, we would not consider Contabo to be premium those days for enterprise users who are trusting a host to keep their sh*t alive.  You would need a sustainable source for your servers to be hosted on.</p> \n\n<p>Falsing information, he made a whole thread about a company called NYMetroCloud who he was claiming to are scammers, having no ToS, walking around with a stolen logo whilst the staff was linking all information required to this (e.g. TOS, Privacy Policy) This is a very young child who is trying with his pocketmoney to start a host, seems familiar doesn't it? After we did expose him for his charges he deleted the thread and instantly friended us on discord with saying \"Am sorry\". The kid does seems like he is 12 years old and firstly decided to apply at us for wanting to be a \"developer / system administrator\". When we said we did not search any he started to become toxic and then the thread was made of us \"stealing logo's\". <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-23/1619220678-375267-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>He was on the same time blackmailing us for \"having the stolen logo\" as mentioned before, and also threatend to made a post on Drama.gg if we did not unban him for advertisements for his own hosts.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-23/1619220854-702982-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-23/1619220928-51582-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Whilst he claimed us to have no ToS, he has only provided us with a simple copied staff rules from another hosting company + discord rules who were claimed to be legal rules.</p>\n\n<p>After this he instantly put his domain / panel offline, what we do call a simple exit scam when it get's to hard to defend yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Now I do not want you guys to attack his host, let this be a lesson for the kid himself. I know the true power of drama.gg, but this is not needed today.</p> \n\n<p>Stay safe buds.</p>\n\n\n\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"406"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3446"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"12544"},{"type":"posts","id":"12545"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"12544","attributes":{"number":10,"createdAt":"2021-04-27T18:02:14+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/406/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"12040\">weedpl</a> May I see were in the discord TOS it says advertising in your status is bannable?

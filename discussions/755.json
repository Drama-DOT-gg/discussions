Some of his skills include overallocating his nodes, scamming people, skidding code, and using nulled software.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, getting back to the topic of this thread. Red Moon Host literally banned me before I even joined the server, and banned my friend as soon as he joined.</p>\n\n<p>Heres some proof,<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851454933223735367/860517904691757062/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The host is also run by kids who don't know what they are doing. This can be seen in the Willypro7 thread and the MoonHost thread linked above.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this, and feel free to add onto this. I am sure there is a lot to add on to this thread, but I just couldn't investigate anything as I was literally banned before joining.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"755"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3351"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"20158","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-07-02T14:12:50+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>This isn't even a host, is a development server where we configure mc servers, discord bots etc, but we have a small host there.

This whole operation is on their Discord server, including billing through discord. They don't even have a proper billing platform. I can't stress enough to hosts that Discord is not a billing platform, so stop using Discord for everything. They're also advertising their hosting on other SMP's Discord servers who are paying customers. I don't know what kind of deal they made with their customers, but if I'm paying them already and not being sponsored for a free server, then why this promotion?</p>\n\n<p>The promotion in a paying customer's SMP server below, he made a channel dedicated to TZ Solutions.<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875884186496532491/882355671671128175/chrome_42424224x.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875884186496532491/882355671671128175/chrome_42424224x.png\"></p>\n\n<p>They're using a .tech domain, which you can get for free from the Github Student Developer Pack. When I DM'ed one of their customers on the host's legitimacy, the customer told the owner (TechZack) about me and I immediately got banned from TZSolutions Discord server. Now, the customer didn't mean it or even thought I was going to get banned. Some hosts just can't take simple criticism even when it's in private messages. The customer was very useful and complying to my investigation and research on TZSolutions. The customer did told me their marketing practices below, which is purely through DM advertising on Discord. Here's the convo below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Okay\nHere i just copied the discussion\nZombieplays04122 â€” 08/27/2021\nHello\nTZ Solutions â€” 08/27/2021\nHow are you doing?\nZombieplays04122 â€” 08/27/2021\nIm good\nTZ Solutions â€” 08/27/2021\nI was wondering how much RAM does your server have?\nZombieplays04122 â€” 08/27/2021\n6\nTZ Solutions â€” 08/27/2021\nHow much do you pay for that?\nZombieplays04122 â€” 08/27/2021\nToo much, 33.98\nTZ Solutions â€” 08/27/2021\nJesus/\nZombieplays04122 â€” 08/27/2021\nmhmh\nther server is about to expire in like 2 hours so i can switch hosting soon\nTZ Solutions â€” 08/27/2021\nWell...

They use HostVenom and their specs for the Chicago location are i7-6700K and likely 64 GB ram (the max memory that processor can handle). The irony here is when they say: \"That would include DDOS Protection 2 Cores of a CPU and 8GB RAM and also being on a Panel This would also stop you being on a Overallocated Server as you would have your own server just for you.\" Really? The i7-6700K only has 4 cores/8 threads and you're giving them 2 cores, which is half of the processor already and 1/8 of the system's memory. If you do the same to one more customer and allocate them 2 cores, then your cores aren't dedicated anymore, they're shared/overallocated.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875884186496532491/882361605365571604/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875884186496532491/882361605365571604/unknown.png\"><br>\nIn their discord, they claim to have secured Los Angeles, Miami, and New York (since the beginning of the month of August 2021). Sounds very much like the whole premium ReliableSite squad, but no. Further investigation shows that they have only one of these locations. In fact, they use Contabo-New York, Hostvenom-Chicago, OVH-Montreal. That's very concentrated on the northeast of North America. <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/list/apex_domain/tzsolutions.tech\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://securitytrails.com/list/apex_domain/tzsolutions.tech</a></p>\n\n<p>euvps-1.tzsolutions.tech Fyeweb - UK<br>\nnavps-2.tzsolutions.tech OVH - Montreal<br>\nnavps-3.tzsolutions.tech HostVenom - Chicago<br>\nnavps-4.tzsolutions.tech Contabo - New York</p>\n\n<p>Also this:<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875884186496532491/882357227837599755/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875884186496532491/882357227837599755/unknown.png\"><br>\nðŸ¤¦Boy, your main website is just a one-page static HTML page.

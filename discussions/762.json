Which is obviously a problem for the host that you work on as you literally <strong>don't give a shit</strong>, I know everything you stated here is opinion based, but it's the one example I can give that you will have a lot of knowledge about and would know what is going on and the things we're criticizing it for.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> DDOS won't improve your life nor will it destroy your enemy host, relax</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't recall any reputable member of Drama.gg, that we know of, or have encouraged to perform a DDOS, we only encourage it strictly for testing purposes and with permission.

And most hosts are made by children/teenagers who aren't even out of puberty.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Totally agree, however having amour business registered isn’t really a must, it really just protects you, and as soon as you grow to a certain degree you can just register then. About the teenager part, I do not believe you understand the difference between just a clueless child who’s using his birthday cash to start your run of the mill Minecraft server host, and people who know what they’re doing and are reputable in the community, like <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Iceey\" class=\"UserMention\">@Iceey</a> for example.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> Aternos remains the best Minecraft hosting service.

Besides that, they have a panel created by themselves, clean and secure.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Aternos has a profitable business plan, however limits in such ways, that they maximise what they get out of their limited hardware and resources, a long queue, tons of marketing (from which they likely make the most money) and the quick auto-shutdown. A custom panel isn’t really that difficult, and you can’t be sure weather or not it’s developed in-house or outsourced.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> Pterodactyl shouldn't be used for anything other than personal use, a host using Ptero as panel just shows how they economize on the user experience. Ptero is not ideal for hosts, and not even visually pretty, even with themes.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Let's take DedicatedMC for example, makes 50k+ a month and use Pterodactyl. Almost all modern hosts use Pterodactyl, and that's cause there is no better alternative. Multicraft for example is old, clunky and expensive. That statement is just wrong in my opinion.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> A dark theme as the main theme is not good, especially when you don't know anything about color palettes and your site looks ugly. Having white as default and optional dark with correct colors shows a cleaner environment, as Aternos does.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Really depends on the market you're in, hosting now is often developers and generally the kind which stays up late. Best is it'd be variable, but creating two UI themes is fairly ambitious for smaller companies, and not really a must.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> Hosts need to use a good support site, + having a forum, Discord isn't ideal and professional, it just shows how inexperienced you are with it...</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Discord is pretty great for that thing, and the largest Minecraft hosts like MCPH use it. Forums don't work for that kind of thing, as I've seen plenty of hosts try that exact thing and fail. Just stick with ticketing if you're that anti-Discord. Also elaborate what you mean by \"it just shows how inexperienced you are with it\", if you mean it shows how inexperienced you are with hosting, then you're dumb.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> Make a host after studying about it, and be over 18, you would spend less shame in your life that way.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree with the first part, people should look into what kind of business their starting, and need to make themselves smart before putting a couple grand into their own venture. The 18 part I disagree with though. I'd say you should be around the age of 16, you can register a company and would be held accountable for your actions (in most countries, depends on where exactly you live). Many great people, like as I mentioned earlier, Iceey, started their hosts under 18 and built up some great businesses.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> If you don't know anything about what you are hosting, don't try doing it.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Nothing to disagree with on that one chief.</p>\n\n<p>On another note, I don't believe you understand that this site isn't about closing hosts, but rather spreading awareness about them and trying to help hosts on the right track, which we do in most cases.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"762"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"20310"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"20319","attributes":{"number":21,"createdAt":"2021-07-03T15:06:31+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> Many people have been trying to make panels, and have failed.

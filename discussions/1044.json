The main reason why people hate CentroNodes is that you need to make coins to create servers. You basically have to AFK on a website, cryptomine, or etc to get coins, then you can create servers. If you are one of those people who are going to say \"why not cryptomine and make money yourself?\", that completely defies the definition of free hosts. You aren't the one handling all the server stuff, nor are the one needing a cryptomine wallet, PayPal, a credit card, or anything like that to use the host.

This host has many downtimes in what I've seen and heard of, and may have some unprofessional staff due to the way the host is managed, but... it's a free host. Expect downtimes. Also, the staff aren't unprofessional in a bad way. They are people from the community and they talk with the community. Getting to know people who use the host, and keep these 'relationships' or something, are actually a really good way of... something.. that rarely hosts do. (Also, Dan is pretty epic.) The host has a website, but something that bothers me is that the host doesn't really seem to get the money it's deserving or enough to keep it sustain. The owner seems to pay for everything, which does show that the owner does care about the community. In a recent conversation I had with Dan (why am I writing this so professionally), it seems like the host can actually sustain itself (regardless of the downtimes), since the owner has a job that pays enough for the nodes. The host definitely overallocates, but you should expect that in a free host. <em>I wouldn't use this host if you want to keep uptime on your server.</em></p>\n\n<p>[i can only think of one more but it isn't really a host but it's just a cool discord bot, it's really hard to find decent/good free hosts]</p>\n","content":"**If you can afford servers/VPSes/dedicated servers from reliable well-known brands, don't use a free host, even though it's for testing or etc reason.** \n\n---\n\nFirst of all, what is a free hosting provider?

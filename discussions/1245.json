I found this hosting company called abacohosting.com which accepted a lot of the crypto currencies as their payment method, they were second on google so I thought it shouldn't be that bad, I was looking to buy a domain name for my minecraft server, I found a .ru domain name that was about 6.80$ yearly, I proceeded to add the domain to cart, and checkout, It asked me for some of my info such as my real name and last name, payment method, password, email and home address, I've successfully registered an account and paid for the domain, but the domain wasn't active for a long time.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-28/1638108224-249261-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nand after some time I decided to open a ticket and ask the support about it, because I though that it might've been an issue on their end that can be resolved fairly quickly.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-28/1638108426-480030-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nshortly after that... 1 hour after they replied asking me for a Russian passport to be provided, yeah you heard it right a Russian passport, I didn't even know what was going on anymore, when I registered to the site I never set my location to Russia but to Serbia instead (Don't confuse Serbia with Siberia, Serbia is located in South East Europe, therefore it doesn't have anything to do with Russia).<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-28/1638108789-668847-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nSince I'm not a Russian citizen and I cannot provide them with the required information, I asked them for a refund or a different domain name, because I believe it's an issue on their end.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-28/1638108882-271364-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nIn a follow up reply they're again asking me for the information, and they didn't want to refund me, as they claim that cryptocurrency payments do not have a refund which is a bull***t, if they received the money they surely can refund it, one way or another.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-28/1638109080-351480-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nand since they said that they can't refund me via crypto I've decided to ask them for a refund directly to my debit card or PayPal and if that isn't possible for whatever reason they can give me account credits as they stated above.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-28/1638109240-557933-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nThey decided to refund me in credits, Which I cannot use for anything because all the other domain names they sell cost around 10 to 30 dollars, so now I have account credits which are of no meaning to me since I can't do anything with them, and if they require Russian passport for the domain registration they should've made the website ask for it as a required field upon purchasing .ru domain, since currently they just allowed me to pay for the domain without even knowing that some additional information will be required, and that way I just lost money, which I still feel bad about, I don't recommend using their services as they're dodgy and I would just recommend sticking with porkbun which I got referred by a friend to, and they also accept crypto payment without asking any of the additional information (and to clarify this is not sponsored by porkbun in any way, this is my honest oppinion)<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-28/1638109431-802491-image.png\"

Kamey_,</p>\n\n<p>People already explained to you it's your problem, you should lookup the requirement when you are buying a foreign country domain and the company has refunded as a credit to your account, you can use the credit to purchase other domain. Why do you want to buy a foreign country domain anyway if you are not their citizen or operating business in their country? It's very common foreign country domain is only available to their citizen and company operating in their country, it's use to protect from fraud and phishing.</p>\n\n<p>Best Regards,<br>\nAllSafe</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1245"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5010"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3901","attributes":{"username":"Kamey_","displayName":"Kamey_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/MobhJsg6xGuIcSsJ.png","slug":"Kamey_","joinTime":"2021-07-05T05:32:59+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":5,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-11-28T16:56:42+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2846","attributes":{"username":"Tomas","displayName":"Tomas","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Q5hYhqTjdnQtMn8K.png","slug":"Tomas","joinTime":"2020-09-30T17:57:04+00:00","discussionCount":5,"commentCount":568,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-09-15T22:15:04+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"NYU8LnXdpP6H51yK.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"my cover is a cars meme I found on facebook","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4955","attributes":{"username":"TheAlex","displayName":"TheAlex","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/QCemA07tJA7U6C54.png","slug":"TheAlex","joinTime":"2021-11-28T23:02:52+00:00","discussionCount":4,"commentCount":91,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-10-16T08:55:25+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"I own Argon Hosting kekw","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4933","attributes":{"username":"SirCat","displayName":"SirCat","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/haqa8i4Ffsqgay0U.png","slug":"SirCat","joinTime":"2021-11-26T07:16:33+00:00","discussionCount":5,"commentCount":224,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-02-15T09:09:30+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4146","attributes":{"username":"Ibrahim","displayName":"Ibrahim","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/kSTDbk63cBUhIlUu.png","slug":"Ibrahim","joinTime":"2021-08-07T10:22:05+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":179,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-08-25T11:25:25+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"5010","attributes":{"username":"AllSafe","displayName":"AllSafe","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"AllSafe","joinTime":"2021-12-06T12:26:34+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":98,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-12-13T13:32:16+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"tags","id":"4","attributes":{"name":"Discussion","description":"Threads which are open for discussion.","slug":"discussion","color":"#15d4a7","backgroundUrl":null,"backgroundMode":null,"icon":"far fa-comment-alt","discussionCount":479,"position":3,"defaultSort":null,"isChild":false,"isHidden":false,"lastPostedAt":"2023-10-24T17:32:49+00:00","canStartDiscussion":true,"canAddToDiscussion":true}}]}

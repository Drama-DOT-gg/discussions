here we go again: kids trying to get their free hosting service. Actually \"the best 24/7 free hosting\". So if this is the \"best\" free hosting service, then any other host are too.</p>\n\n<p>Basically in a few words: they think TOS is rules, no privacy policy whatsoever, the worst English possible (even tho I'm french and I do not have the best English in the world, I can tell you than their English is really something), you need to create tickets to have a server, stealing designs from QuackHost (the free hosting I made with J0SH, that got bought in the beginning of July) and finally, their servers are created manually, and sometimes actually he just creates servers in other free hosting and give them to people.<br>\nHere we go guys, this is the \"best\" free hosting service.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's begin with.... Their TOS!!!! wait, their rules actually. Because yes, their \"TOS\" is just actually rules, and not even finished:<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shadowdev.ga/25746.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shadowdev.ga/25749.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>But, even before it became rules, it was just this:<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shadowdev.ga/25751.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Next up we have... no privacy policy!<br>\n<em>No screenshots to show here, because there is umm... no privacy policy.</em></p>\n\n<p>Now, the owner, VFarakiuD, has the worst English that I've ever seen, and want to actually make an English only discord server. Even tho I'm french and I make some spelling/grammar mistakes sometimes, I can tell you that his English his actually the worst I've ever seen:<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shadowdev.ga/25755.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<em>and that's just one example...</em></p>\n\n<p>Then, they are stealing design from QuackHost, which was an host josh and me made, that recently got sold. Even tho it got sold and I really do not care about theses designs, it's just to show you guys how lazy they are:<br>\nTheir server:<br>\n<img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/823821762579660850/862778430066786335/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nQuackHost:<br>\n<img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/823821762579660850/862778455577985034/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Their server:<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shadowdev.ga/25757.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nQuackHost:<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shadowdev.ga/25759.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Well you get the point right...<br>\nBut the good stuff is coming: this guy is manually creating servers, and just actually reselling game hosting from ectrix host.<br>\nEmerald Mike (the owner of ectrix) said it;<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.shadowdev.ga/25761.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, they are the dumbest kids that are trying to make a free hosting service. They don't know the difference between IP and hostnames, they think you can backup a Minecraft server only with the IP and so on.</p>\n\n<p>If you guys have any other things to say about them, feel free to send it. A thread will be never enough for them.</p>","editedAt":"2021-07-08T20:44:16+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"779"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2850"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2850"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"23488"},{"type":"posts","id":"23975"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"23488","attributes":{"number":64,"createdAt":"2021-08-07T16:58:35+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/779/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"21007\">X_Shadow_</a> \"creating tickets to get servers\" yes where are we supposed to create servers for ppl if we dont have a web in general?

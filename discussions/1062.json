Considering that they are collecting data and using data, they don't seem to be telling you how they store it and how safe your data really is. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-01/1633120667-327792-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<em>Above- A footer on the website where the legal documentation should be linked to be seen on every page but isn't</em></p>\n\n<p>After some digging, I found what \"appears\" to be their privacy policy and terms of conditions.

Their Discord server has a total of 200-300 members that are either inactive or active, which wouldn't be an issue if they weren't faking the voting statistics of their own bot. The bot is unverified but has 10k+ votes? Their site doesn't have good or any SEO and it has 10k+ votes.

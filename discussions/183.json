They do have some issues that they need to figure out but honestly make things a lot easier by providing a place to get multiple servers at the same time. I used them for a short while but eventually left due to 6+hr response times and them always blaming it on \"waiting for the other provider to respond\" but I eventually just started using the direct provider and can always get responses in minutes. I think they have grown over what they can properly support and they need to re-look at their company. This being said what they did was wrong but most likely not their fault being that all of their servers are resold. Most likely the reseller did something wrong.</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"183"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2827"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3039"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"121"}]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3039","attributes":{"username":"Abooz","displayName":"Abooz","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/wtHK77raTr0S24WV.png","slug":"Abooz","joinTime":"2021-01-24T21:53:51+00:00","discussionCount":5,"commentCount":66,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-11-05T10:22:20+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2827","attributes":{"username":"AlexPads","displayName":"AlexPads","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/hCnChVyLUrzQ2GqW.png","slug":"AlexPads","joinTime":"2020-09-21T18:29:20+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":5,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-12-20T23:25:30+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"121","attributes":{"userId":3039,"postId":5699,"reactionId":1}}]}

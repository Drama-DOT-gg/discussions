That should be a Owner privledge. Along with the roles in EpikHost being absolute fucked beyond belief and nobody seems to care to repare them.

Skittle122 was salty BECAUSE he got a role without doing much as a mod and barely did anything when first promoted because of the perms in the discord server being dogshit and being fucked.

Being head mod and being active 24/7 yet SpaceDoggo goes directly from mod to Co-Owner in a matter of days. Not to mention 90% of the current staff team after the bans handed out by Rin for these actions on this thread, are all underage.

But as of recent conversations and experience's from users, it appears that their hosting company is doing unethical acts.</p> \n\n<h3>Advertising on Other People's Host</h3>\n<p>Context: Apparently the owner of SnowyNodes, brycecarpenter#2962, decided it would be a clever idea to advertise his own hosting server onto other hosting service's discords. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-26/1666750100-993651-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-26/1666750113-278543-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The owner, \"henryy\" attempted to confront Bryce for why he was advertising on his server. Bryce did not seem to show any hint of respect and decided to insist that \"this was funny.\"</p> \n\n\n<h3>Copying NameCheap's ToS</h3>\n<p>What's interesting about their ToS is that in some places of the document, it contains the name of NameCheap. Ex. \"<em>Namecheap has the absolute right, in its sole discretion, to terminate its Services and close Your account.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>After doing some background research, it appears that they <strong>copied it from Namecheap.</strong><br>\nSnowyNode's ToS: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wT7phHnh9NQIYZFeuFPZJ_3SuMuD7YgzJ09NM1i3dHQ/edit\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wT7phHnh9NQIYZFeuFPZJ_3SuMuD7YgzJ09NM1i3dHQ/edit</a><br>\nNameCheap's ToS: <a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/legal/hosting/tos/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.namecheap.com/legal/hosting/tos/</a></p>\n\n<p>Ex.<br>\nNameCheap's First Two Lines of the ToS:<br>\n<em>You agree that Namecheap may modify this Agreement and the Services it offers to You from time to time. You agree to be bound by any changes Namecheap may reasonably make to this Agreement when such changes are made.</em></p>\n\n<p>SnowyNode's First Two Lines of their ToS:<br>\n<em>You agree that SnowyNode may modify this Agreement and the Services it offers to You from time to time. You agree to be bound by any changes Namecheap may reasonably make to this Agreement when such changes are made.</em></p>\n\n<p>The funny part about SnowyNode's ToS is the fact that they FORGOT to remove NameCheap's name in some areas of their ToS.</p> \n\n\n\n<h3>Stealing Another Website's Design</h3>\n<p>\"Host\" &gt; <a href=\"https://snowynode.co.uk/hosting-cloud.html\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://snowynode.co.uk/hosting-cloud.html</a> (Origin: <a href=\"https://snowynode.co.uk/index.html\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://snowynode.co.uk/index.html</a>)<br>\nTheme &gt; <a href=\"https://madebydesignesia.com/themes/hostco/hosting-cloud.html\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://madebydesignesia.com/themes/hostco/hosting-cloud.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Apparently you can trace back the design of their website to another website's theme. Even if they bought it (which is a doubt since zero evidence conclude so), they appear to forgot to properly finish their page.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-26/1666750316-564009-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-26/1666750323-81644-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Violating FiveM Tos</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://snowynode.co.uk/whmcs/index.php?rp=/store/gta-v-hosting\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://snowynode.co.uk/whmcs/index.php?rp=/store/gta-v-hosting</a><br>\nIn addition, they make profit by violating FiveM's ToS.

My name is callum and I was the official owner of snowynode which sadly shut down until further notice. The website theme was giving to me by a hosting Ive known for ages as they didnâ€™t use it anymore and yes thatâ€™s my fault for not finishing the template due to school starting again. I understand the FIVEM TOS part but you see Allmost every big and small hosting company doing it am I wrong? Iâ€™m not trying to start a fuss as the company has shut down now. But I would just like to reply to this and fill you lot on some information. We donâ€™t scam I could see the point weâ€™re he was coming from about it as I didnâ€™t finish things as I was the only one who kinda knew how to do it all and was basically on my own, Bryce was alright for a few days then he starting being rude to members in snowynode saying racist comments, being horrible, then it started happening to me saying I was gay, racist comment to me, telling me to hurry up with things when I wanted to take my time with putting stress on me, saying I didnâ€™t know how to do my job and I was shit at it so I lost abit of confidence in hosting. I did give Bryce several warnings and members on snowynode did come to me about Bryce saying you will lose your company but I kept giving second chances which I shouldnâ€™t have so itâ€™s partly my fault. But by giving the second chances we lose reputation in our hosting. But Bryce will no longer be executive in any of my hostings in future. So I shut down snowynode because of that loss of reputation and the way he treated me as I didnâ€™t have no more confidence left in me. But a few of my hosting mates saw how he treats the community and spoke to him you would have seen some of the screen shot further up about it which made me a little happy that some people had my back. I allways tried my best with the hosting but he dragged it down to the point weâ€™re there is no more snowynode.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you lot have any questions please reply and I will get back to you when I can thank you

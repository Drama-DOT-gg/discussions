He said yes and we added it to all our branding and the logo is now our companys face. Yesterday, he said he revoked all right we had to use it and claimed he would take us to court if we didn't take it down. He said the reason was \"he wanted to use it for another company\". I then had to remind him that he doesn't have the right to a logo he stole off of online lol. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629632047-929923-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629632067-473952-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629632084-380910-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629632117-226897-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The guy then went on to saying I was lying about colournodes registration status and later said he would bring that up in court too.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629632166-116516-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629632181-387123-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>And below is where I showed him his logo he \"had the right to\" all over the internet.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629632230-395505-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629632248-914546-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>Then attempted scaring me.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629632283-267121-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Bad uptime</strong></p>\n\n<p>He owns the company named FloofyHosting (<a href=\"https://floofyhosting.com\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://floofyhosting.com</a>) and started it with me before kicking me out (That was his decision, so I don't have an issue with that). He was one of the people who helped with a test free host me and Two and Daft made called CrystalHost and he provided us with the VPSs. This was when I realised I should not have trusted him. There was constant panel downtime and the VPSs didn't work half the time. When they went off and I messaged him, he would blame it on DNS issues and say he SSHd in and fixed it. I could tell his VPS panel (Solus something) was installed in a big rush as half of the things on the VPS page had permission issues or just flat out didn't work.</p>\n\n<p>He also admitted to me that to push his uptime up on his status page, he set the timings to 15 minutes per ping to make it look like they were constantly online.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-22/1629631843-706005-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>I will let everyone else do some more digging about his company.</p>\n\n<p>It is also very ironic that after I block the DDoSer, our main node at colournodes is under attack. <a href=\"https://us01.colournodes.com:8080\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://us01.colournodes.com:8080</a>.

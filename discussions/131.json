De0 was a 4GB node only for the panel. Rus said he was getting us a De2 and after he installed it he said it wasnt ready. A day later he says its ready and we put our stats bot on there. Guess what it shows? The De0 information. Rus had just put wings on the panel vps and said he bought us a node. <br>\nRus gave us a De3. He said that De3 was its own node and not being used on raided. Our de3 stats went online and it showed the same stats as a raided node. The same thing happened with heik. De3 = some raided node = Free1. They are all the same vps's. Rus told me these vps's were different.<br>\nOk now with the scam hosts:<br>\nAll of his hosts have managed to shutdown within a week of opening, Lavanodes shutdown and so did raided. Now heik is basically dead. He seems to always shutdown his hosts a week after opening.

He kept nuking a channel for a bot that I made which reset its ID and made the bot go offline because the ID changed and he would always complain and say that it is my fault however I had told him not to nuke it. next when I said I was don't with his bull crap I said I would leave and I took my nodes with me. He decided however to go onto them and completely overclock and fry the shit out of them. I got this message from my node manager as you can see below.<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-12/1610442080-655704-img-7868.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe then proceeds to claim I \"Stole his github code\" which I was never added to for 1 and 2 I never new he had code on github. He then proceeds to say he will sue me because I \"threatened\" to turn off a bot <strong><em>I</em></strong> made because he kept making it crash and complaining. Then he asks my friend to do something on screenshare and got access to his account then sent me an IP grabber link in the for of a short URL. Unfortunately, He deleted the messages so I can't provide a screenshot. He also send this link here: <a href=\"https://iplogger.org/logger/8rdnt32kAYG5/tab=info/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://iplogger.org/logger/8rdnt32kAYG5/tab=info/</a> in a groupchat with him and the people he does arkhost with \"claiming\" he got my IP and attempted to ddos my VPN IP. I am clever and use a VPN before I click random links. Please be careful of this guy and I am trying to get his company shut down for him ddosing and just being completely immature.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"149"}},"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"posts","id":"4353","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-01-13T22:17:01+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Here's how this drama started.

This is a bit of a paid host tier list, made one before but i'm trying to make it better. If you have any suggestions on what to add please respond to the thread, thanks.</p>\n\n<p>Minecraft Server Hosting tier list.</p> \n\n<p>Note, this was completely unbias. I paid for this out of my own pocket. This whole review is 100% honest.</p>\n\n<p>WitherHosting - <a href=\"https://witherhosting.com\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://witherhosting.com</a></p>\n\n<p>CPU: Intel Core i9 10900K</p>\n\n<p>CPU Performance: 104CPS, that's really good! - Note, this was measured with Chunky, a chunk rendering plugin. It tests CPU Performance.</p>\n\n<p>Memory: WitherHosting uses DDR4 3200MHz to push the i9 10900K well with your server. - Note, this is your server cache you can say, what runs it as well as it can.</p>\n\n<p>Storage: 100% NVMe storage to provide great performance, my server started in 1 second! - Note, this is what holds your server. With the fast storage your server is lighting fast.</p>\n\n<p>Locations: WitherHosting has a plethora of locations, here they are! <a href=\"https://witherhosting.com/locations.html\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://witherhosting.com/locations.html</a> - Note, this is where the host has servers. So where your minecraft server can get located.</p>\n\n<p>Final: WitherHosting has great performance on a budget with 1$ per GB ram and cheap cores to go with your server, I would use it! Here is a promocode for everyone who read this far. Code: Performance</p>\n\n<p>Notes: Location used was NYC and server specs were 4GB Ram and 4 VCores.</p>\n\n<p>PebbleHost - <a href=\"https://pebblehost.com\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://pebblehost.com</a></p>\n\n<p>CPU: Intel Xeon E5-1650V3</p>\n\n<p>CPU Performance: 15CPS, that's REALLY bad. They also modified the scores, why did it show 1500? - Note, this was measured with Chunky, a chunk rendering plugin. It tests CPU Performance.</p>\n\n<p>Memory: PebbleHost uses DDR4 2400MHz, pretty overrated for the Intel Xeon E5-1650V3 but it's pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>Storage: Enterprise Grade SSD storage to provide pretty good performance with the Intel Xeon E5-1650V3.</p> \n\n<p>Locations: PebbleHost has Canada &amp; Europe, pretty much it.</p>\n\n<p>Final: Tried to modify scores. BOO. Performance sucked anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Notes: Location used was North America / Canada and server spces were 4GB Ram Budget.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4026"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1106"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"30"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"31329"},{"type":"posts","id":"31670"}]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1219"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1220"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4026","attributes":{"username":"IoNetty","displayName":"IoNetty","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/bxpKLp1Y6DahxxDT.png","slug":"IoNetty","joinTime":"2021-07-21T13:07:55+00:00","discussionCount":4,"commentCount":247,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-04-02T02:26:55+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"30","attributes":{"username":"Triassic","displayName":"Triassic","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/vpuY80JJaf7LHX7q.png","slug":"Triassic"}},{"type":"users","id":"4643","attributes":{"username":"SchoolRobotProMachine500","displayName":"SchoolRobotProMachine500","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/53Ju6nSCMaZi3dp6.png","slug":"SchoolRobotProMachine500"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1106","attributes":{"title":"Little paid host PSA.","slug":"1106-little-paid-host-psa","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"31329","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-10-18T02:25:57+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1106/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"31321\">IoNetty</a> here are a few hosts you should add Colournodes,Powelt,Kubbur,scalacube</p>"},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1106"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"31670","attributes":{"number":13,"createdAt":"2021-10-19T17:14:31+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1106/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"31321\">IoNetty</a> please add explosive burned toaster hosting solutions to the list it is the leading #1 hosting provider in the world with 8 locations and the website is hacked by bad hacker right now but when I will unhack it you can find it at <a href=\"http://explosive-burned-toaster-host.tk\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">http://explosive-burned-toaster-host.tk</a></p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4643"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1106"}}}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1219","attributes":{"userId":30,"postId":31321,"reactionId":1}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1220","attributes":{"userId":2827,"postId":31321,"reactionId":1}}]}

I am diagnosed with breast cancer and I asked for donations to help paying for it. People donated, I got enough to pay half of the treatments because of that, which I am very grateful for.</p>\n\n<p>That I have a server box, is from other sources. How do you know where I get money from? I work 2 jobs and every penny I have to spare goes towards the server box that I have.</p>\n\n<p>You are such a damn asshole for using my cancer diagnose to attempt to win a case.  That is just low.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2994"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"156"}}}}]}

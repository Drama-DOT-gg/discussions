It's a complete joke, owners cannot be trusted and all priorities are FUCKED. Its fucking terrible, for the love of god please move your services off of there before you get your database leaked TOO.</p>\n\n<p>An owner \"Matt\" has been found publicly releasing customer address's live on stream in multiple places, he has also shown himself viewing the virtual servers of his clients WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION and touching / taking the files on said servers. While he is doing this, he is more focused on his radio station XX.X The Shitty Hosting Provider or whatever it's called... Meanwhile he manages to leak ALL OF HIS DIRECT ADMIN INFORMATION.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>After being accused of not owning a license to WHMCS, which is clearly shown here:<br>\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hyperz.net/u/main/ZJvYYm8.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"proofnolicense\"></p>\n\n<p>He then decides to \"show proof he owns a license\" and posts this image to the announcements channel:<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hyperz.net/u/main/wrHOgfj.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"directadminlicense\"> <br>\n(<a href=\"https://cdn.hyperz.net/u/main/leBUHsP.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">full chat screenshot</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Which is <strong>NOT PROOF</strong> that he owns a license to WHMCS (because he didn't), it's just proof that he pays for DirectAdmin. While in the mean time he <em>IS using a NULLED copy</em> of WHMCS. Of-course, after that being said, and the word spreading, they decided to go ahead and buy that license to their pirated software.</p>\n\n<p>So, they bought a license to it:<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hyperz.net/u/main/Iln5q3f.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"theybuythelicenseaftergettingcaught\"></p>\n\n<p>Overall this company is now trying to play cover-up after being publicly exposed and losing multiple partners and affiliates from using stolen and NULLED software and violating so many of it's clients.</p>\n\n","editedAt":"2022-08-16T21:23:08+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4603"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"41"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2006"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4603","attributes":{"username":"Hyperz","displayName":"Hyperz","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/k7jMQnyrSCQX5yQp.png","slug":"Hyperz","joinTime":"2021-10-10T23:34:52+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":8,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-11-19T18:27:45+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"41","attributes":{"username":"Robert","displayName":"Robert","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/y24i4SFwKYCqRsxU.png","slug":"Robert"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2006","attributes":{"title":"J&M Hosting","slug":"2006-jm-hosting","isApproved":true}}]}

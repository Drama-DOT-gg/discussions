Some more than others (Bonjour my baguette), Just because you don't like the fact someone opened a thread to call out your company doesn't give you the excuse to open another thread attempting to call them out because you don't think their view is right. If a thread has incorrect information, request one of the moderators to review the thread, they will then check the information out and change its status if it deserves changing.</p>\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3416"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"906"}}}}]}

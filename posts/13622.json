I'm Josh, a Filipino Minecraft Youtuber and I am the owner of NemocrafySMP which was running on Omninodes. Enfernee gave me a 2GB server for our sponsorship so I can start my first ever Minecraft server which is Nemocraft. My only problem is that when I asked them to give us a 5GB server he told us we had to pay 375 pesos every month, which<br>\nmade us think \"Why would we need to pay\". It seems unfair to us so we were forced to switch to a different hosting since my friend also told me that it's a scam. I realized that my friend was right, and thankfully we moved before this happened. Let's just say the sponsorship was worthless because of this.</p>\n\n<p>Mabuhay ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"460"}}}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"408","attributes":{"userId":3379,"postId":13622,"reactionId":3}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"409","attributes":{"userId":7,"postId":13622,"reactionId":3}}]}

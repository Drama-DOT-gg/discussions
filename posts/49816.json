(as well as remove your assets that are associated with the company)</p>\n\n<p>However, I am falling under the assumption that this was a \"partnership\" not a \"sole prop\" because you claim that:</p>\n<ul><li>you hosted some of clients for the hosting company</li>\n<li>and you stated you were formal \"ceo\"</li></ul>\n\n<p>In a case like that,  usually people make contracts to work together as CEOs and if one decides to break the contract then it is voided. Since Pengu is a minor, no contract can ever be made.<br>\n(Because people in this hosting community likes to work with underaged people instead of business-educated people)</p>\n\n<p>As for the data leaks, this is a serious problem that can't be treated unnoticed. The fact that someone managed to get access inside the hosting company (even after being fired) shows the vulnerability and liability this company has.</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7004"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"49819"},{"type":"posts","id":"49827"},{"type":"posts","id":"49831"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"7004","attributes":{"username":"Young","displayName":"Young","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/jjOfAwYfyJgg1Yl7.png","slug":"Young","joinTime":"2022-11-23T03:53:13+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":19,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-07-15T19:19:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"7096","attributes":{"username":"Pengu","displayName":"Pengu","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/1eQRNFMALLaeH1YR.png","slug":"Pengu"}},{"type":"users","id":"7097","attributes":{"username":"TravenGG","displayName":"TravenGG","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/4nBi3GqkULpSZZC5.png","slug":"TravenGG"}},{"type":"users","id":"4739","attributes":{"username":"TheYeetster","displayName":"TheYeetster","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Bzg1ypsYeixFBMGH.png","slug":"TheYeetster"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2115","attributes":{"title":"Galactiq - A facade of Fraud and Theft","slug":"2115-galactiq-a-facade-of-fraud-and-theft","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"49819","attributes":{"number":17,"createdAt":"2023-02-19T20:09:22+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2115/14\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"49816\">Young</a> I'm glad you brought up the data breach! I do take full responsibility for this. We did our best to restrict access and lock Yeetster and Voll out however I failed to take into consideration they had company code on their computer still which contained security keys. Sadly they did send me a list of the exposed data (Names and Emails) and I have full intention of taking action against them. As far as we're concerned we've completely locked them out and revoked all keys. I've already informed people of the breach and I've contacted affected persons privately and apologized.</p> \n\n<p>This is something I do not want to be able to happen at Galactiq and moving forward we're moving to far more drastic and secure methods of encrypting our keys and making sure that no one person can ever just have them which is what we should have done from the beginning.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7096"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"49827","attributes":{"number":25,"createdAt":"2023-02-19T20:15:33+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2115/14\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"49816\">Young</a> you don’t call yourself a CEO in the professional world till you have a registered business and several employees making the company big enough to called for the CEO position.</p> \n\n<p>Max is also 17, so he legally can’t make anyone sign contracts either.

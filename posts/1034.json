I am the current owner of this company and I think there is a lot of confusion. First off we DO NOT resell Contabo. We do not like Contabo for the way they treated us in the past. Also we recently switched where our WHMCS was located and we are contacting WHMCS to move our license over to the new location. I am sorry about all of the confusion and hope you understand. Please reply if you have any other questions! Have an amazing day and stay safe!</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"91"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"50"}}}}]}

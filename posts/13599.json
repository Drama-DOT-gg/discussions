You guys are 12 y/o. You cannot take legal action for anything that happens and you can also not afford to start a hosting company at the age of 12 without scamming people or stealing your parents money. 12 y/o's don't even know the basics of sys admin or anything, you're too inexperienced and simply can't afford to have a hosting company so just don't until you get way older and learn a lot about the industry. <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/PugRug\" class=\"UserMention\">@PugRug</a> ^</p>","editedAt":"2021-05-07T01:52:49+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"104"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"104"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"173"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"13600"},{"type":"posts","id":"13601"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"104","attributes":{"username":"INfoUpgraders","displayName":"INfoUpgraders","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/xOdfOBiwrFMEliCO.png","slug":"INfoUpgraders","joinTime":"2020-08-26T21:33:30+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":52,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-06-24T15:18:11+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"ok","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3354","attributes":{"username":"Technical_difficulty","displayName":"Technical_difficulty","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/OCNDnVbg4gEWpNKF.png","slug":"Technical_difficulty"}},{"type":"users","id":"3530","attributes":{"username":"Verse","displayName":"Verse","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/vjbz2AeKzq7bvwC5.png","slug":"Verse"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"173","attributes":{"title":"Puggo","slug":"173-puggo","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"13600","attributes":{"number":377,"createdAt":"2021-05-07T04:19:50+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/173/376\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"13599\">INfoUpgraders</a> ++</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3354"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"173"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"13601","attributes":{"number":378,"createdAt":"2021-05-07T04:34:05+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/173/376\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"13599\">INfoUpgraders</a> For the legal action, I am contacting people who know lawyers, attorneys, etc... For now we can start small with the hosting. We have never scammed anyone or stole money either. Even if Puggo doesn't know much about being a system admin, we have many staff that do. I agree that we learn a lot more about the industry and get older, but we want to start early and see how things go. Thanks for the advice, if this host dies or doesn't work out, we will consider your opinion on waiting until we know more about the hosting industry.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3530"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"173"}}}}]}

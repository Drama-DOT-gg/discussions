Like I said, if you don't believe us in two weeks or less we will be putting up a new node for a real company. I still don't understand why I hate so much. Why don't you report to CentroNodes? I am inviting you to what you are doing. Another thing, could you know what rules I broke? I am very sure that you were the boy who entered our server. You also have no arguments or evidence to call us liars. Or could I know?

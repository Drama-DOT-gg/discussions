I can confirm personally no machine we use or have ever used has been a trial machine.</p> \n\n<p>I would gladly provide proof of Invoices from the start of Flow Nodes to current. I can also provide a full inventory of our devices and proof of payment for each individual device since purchase. If anyone would like me to post the evidence regarding anything I have previously stated I would gladly.</p>\n\n<p>Please, before making any accusations about a company or an individual, get your facts confirmed and actually find physical evidence of the issues you have with the people you are slandering.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nCain</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3416"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1299"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"4996"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"38147"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3416","attributes":{"username":"Cain","displayName":"Cain","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/xwjaqVpRZualQYHr.png","slug":"Cain","joinTime":"2021-04-20T11:33:57+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":30,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-11T19:40:34+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4996","attributes":{"username":"Dubss","displayName":"Dubss","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/cQF43zc1D4HLRd5M.png","slug":"Dubss"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1299","attributes":{"title":"Shershah | Raiding","slug":"1299-shershah-raiding","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"38147","attributes":{"number":31,"createdAt":"2021-12-15T19:37:50+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1299/23\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"38092\">Cain</a> Hey, what's your discord?</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4996"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1299"}}}}]}

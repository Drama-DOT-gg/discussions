I have personally seen evidence of him paying for the machines. Flow has been around for many months and at this point past the 30 Day OVH Trial Period. The machine itself has had the same IP the whole time confirming the machine is not a trial. Cain is hard worker, and personally funds every server Flow Node Uses.</p>\n\n<p>Yours Sincerely,<br>\nLiquidInteract<br>\nStaff @ Flow Node</p>","editedAt":"2021-12-16T21:41:19+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4168"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4168"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1299"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4168","attributes":{"username":"LiquidInteract","displayName":"LiquidInteract","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/KeVdkIL3fKJhukT7.png","slug":"LiquidInteract","joinTime":"2021-08-11T23:44:27+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":1,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-08-25T12:56:49+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1299","attributes":{"title":"Shershah | Raiding","slug":"1299-shershah-raiding","isApproved":true}}]}

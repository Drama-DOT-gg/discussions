note jesse is a complete ammature when it comes to Linux,hosting,financing and such so when i noticed this i dmed her and asked her how she was management dept just 1 min later i got banned and dchu dmed me saying he had recieved reports about me and he himself admitted its because of jesse anyways as i said that this was stupid and all i did was dm jesse and asked how he got management dep afterwhich he said he banned me for pinging owners for “no reason”.Anyways i was banned for a day and was unbanned again.This time i was made management dep this time i tried to do my job without being banned again i went to dchu and told him how the prices are unsustainable and that they could not get us profit.And that due to Free nitro from epic games many people collected their boost plans which were absurd and like 80% of server resources were used for boost plans.So i thought since he didnt want to listen to my advice ill leave him be.Then i decided to work on a theme for mehost so a admin called cactus made me a acc without SPA(note this).And due to me not knowing the pass reset link was sent to my email i could not even login to my acc.Anyways i wake up the next day to see im demoted to member when i asked what happened a owner called neil said that i had abused my spa and had deleted a users server(suprising how i was the one being accused after i dmed neil about something) anyways he proceeded to send me a screenshot with my acc as admin.Then i told dchu to check panel logs and check for the ip from neils acc and “my” acc if they were the same we would know if it was neil trying to frame me.Neil knowing he couldnt win started accusing me of hacking his account and that he was going to leave because he kept getting accused and he left.Afterwards dchu made me management dept again and i went to sleep i then wake up to me being banned and in the group chat there is no info with just people saying i ruined mehost again and they left the group chat and dchu blocked me again with no info then i come to know from a friend that dchu had accused me of raiding mehost and running rm -rf on his nodes.And even when i tried to talk it out with dchu through my friend dchu didnt listen so knowing its a lost cause i stopped trying but then due to his false claims i was many people started accusing me of raiding and such so i had enough of it .Not only did he lose user data and got raided he could not stand to admit his own fault and went on to accuse me.SO i started a drama.gg thread to prove that i did not raid in anyway.And in the thread i managed to prove that i did not raid.And dchu admitted to accusing me without proof anyways i decide to forgive him and help mehost again,Even after all the trouble he put me through.Anyways here is the reason why The Whole management of Mehost is plan “stupid”.They had a hetzner dedicated server which had 64gb ram and 4 cores for MC hosting one of their plans was $2 for 6gb ram + swap and 5 cores and yet had the nerve to ask me why they were not making profit well thining they didnt think about it i gave them a more sustainable price point for servers.Just 2 days later i see. that the panel name has changed to ME|Dary|Ace and when i asked dchu he said he had sold a node to Dary and Ace both which are hosting companies so i asked him how much money he made he then revealed that he forgot and was too lazy to even ask for the PAYMENT!.So me and Io.netty had to confront them and we came to know that the hosts have no money to pay so we ended up revoking the node.AfterWhich dchu made a announcement saying that he was closing down mehost so i gave dchu some advice and said that closing mehost will result in more losses then gain.And that he should keep on going this happened twice</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1016"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"29029"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"discussions","id":"1016","attributes":{"title":"Zachery#8732 | posting user datas to public community | blocking spa","slug":"1016-zachery8732-posting-user-datas-to-public-community-blocking-spa","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"29029","attributes":{"number":160,"createdAt":"2021-09-20T05:17:15+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1016/43\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"28910\">Zachery</a> here if you dont know how to scroll</p>"},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1016"}}}}]}

Maybe a quarter) is just BS. Make your own panel instead of using industry standard production code, which is opensource and is best? Hell nah. You should focus more on the quality of the service, not the looks of the service. You're custom written panel can have several bugs or might have security vulnerabilities too, auditing it is another cost to incur. To avoid all those extra expenses, just use a production software like Pterodactyl. Just because someone is tired of seeing same panel over and over again, we can't switch.</p>\n\n\n<p>P.S - This is my opinion, if you're willing to argue around. Sure. I got time!</p>","editedAt":"2023-02-25T16:35:28+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3163"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3163"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2117"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3163","attributes":{"username":"FatGrizzly","displayName":"FatGrizzly","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/iS888BblAzGJgvnV.png","slug":"FatGrizzly","joinTime":"2021-02-28T14:29:51+00:00","discussionCount":6,"commentCount":431,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-10-08T07:56:22+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"hello bitch","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2117","attributes":{"title":"I'm Sick of Hositng Companies and This Needs to be Taken Care of","slug":"2117-im-sick-of-hositng-companies-and-this-needs-to-be-taken-care-of","isApproved":true}}]}

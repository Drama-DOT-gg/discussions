Here is what he answered.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618343114-896580-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe removed one of the messages while he was typing, which contained \"I also contributed\" or something similar to that, but I didn't have enough time to screenshot it. So we took it further. We contacted the owner of the website. He said that they stole the design. I will not re-share the screenshot because I'm not the guy that DMED him.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE - 3 mins later. : He deleted the website right now.<br>\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210306204801/https://www.primesrv.net/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://web.archive.org/web/20210306204801/https://www.primesrv.net/</a></p>","editedAt":"2021-04-13T21:03:39+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"321"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"discussions","id":"34","attributes":{"title":"Lamaker/ItzAwesome/Lily/Pamar | FalixNodes/Falix.gg & PrimeSRV","slug":"34-lamakeritzawesomelilypamar-falixnodesfalixgg-primesrv","isApproved":true}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"321","attributes":{"userId":2864,"postId":10848,"reactionId":15}}]}

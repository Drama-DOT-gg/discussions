I wonder why that's hmm, you'll probably know later in this thread.<br>\nAnd a major red flag is that it's owned by J0SH and samm. You'll read about that later in this thread.</p>\n\n<p>Proof of J0SH's age:<br>\n<img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/bd7becd1-d38b-4a0d-abfa-cb5ce25d2807.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Proof of samm's age:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677160933-665846-screenshot-2023-02-23-19-31-34-69.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Their FUP (Fair Usage Policy) also mentions that users are only allowed to use 80% of the cpu on their VMs consistently, which indicates that they overallocate by probably, a lot.<br>\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20230210075429/https://hostaris.com/fup\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">http://web.archive.org/web/20230210075429/https://hostaris.com/fup</a></p>\n\n<p>Also their terms of service has been writing by ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) according to J0SH.

And he refuses to fix the afk app vulns since even after explaining countless times that it is vulnerable, he does not care. So if you use OptikServers, do not use their afk app and actually just avoid using it. For a more detailed version of this, please check out the old thread: <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2118\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://drama.gg/d/2118</a></p>\n\n\n<h1>CortexNodes</h1>\n<p>There isn't much about cortexnodes other than the fact that samm owns it and it uses heliactyl, and it also had a RCE vuln exposed which has now been fixed since I reported it. CortexNodes has been included in this thread solely because it's owned by samm and to tell people not to use it since they'd probably be risking their personal data.</p>\n\n<p>Now coming onto J0SH and samm themselves.</p>\n\n<h1>Samm</h1>\n<p>To start off, samm's one heck of a racist person. He's also banned from the drama.gg for potentially ddosing the site and for being homophobic.<br>\nRead the messages below (in the drama.gg discord) and also see the screenshots after that.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://canary.discord.com/channels/730015520568639509/730023081489203241/955925846554710116\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://canary.discord.com/channels/730015520568639509/730023081489203241/955925846554710116</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://canary.discord.com/channels/730015520568639509/730023081489203241/952650781943816233\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://canary.discord.com/channels/730015520568639509/730023081489203241/952650781943816233</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://canary.discord.com/channels/730015520568639509/730023081489203241/952590438743805962\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://canary.discord.com/channels/730015520568639509/730023081489203241/952590438743805962</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://canary.discord.com/channels/730015520568639509/730023081489203241/952603379463520328\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://canary.discord.com/channels/730015520568639509/730023081489203241/952603379463520328</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677186812-424421-screenshot-2023-02-24-02-19-08-02-572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/85b86570-0d03-40f3-b857-490c2c11fabf.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/2dde71fa-5308-4d13-b48f-18ec98357cb4.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/a02c5e08-db02-4ae2-8abc-541c5980184e.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nThey've (samm and J0SH) also been shipping me with people, whom I will not mention here.<br>\n<img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/83745fb3-98d0-4f0e-906f-dcb0f7b21654.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677186848-931344-screenshot-2023-02-24-02-36-22-70-572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677186855-215300-screenshot-2023-02-22-04-59-38-46-572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677186871-760764-screenshot-2023-02-24-02-35-35-45-572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>This is another accusation, not from me but from someone else, however there's no actual evidence to back this up but I'm adding it here in case someone is aware about it and wants to provide evidence:<br>\n<img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/afc613b5-a117-4bcc-931d-4d2d374307d7.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<h1>J0SH</h1>\n<p>Most of it about J0SH was covered in the original thread, but I'll still attach some screenshots which speak for themselves basically.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677186684-748164-screenshot-2023-02-24-02-36-43-43-572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677186697-222590-screenshot-2023-02-24-02-35-35-45-572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677186712-955697-screenshot-2023-02-24-02-34-29-48-572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677186720-394532-screenshot-2023-02-24-02-34-04-65-572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n","editedAt":"2023-02-23T21:26:00+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2951"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2951"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2119"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2951","attributes":{"username":"Chirag","displayName":"Chirag","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/EBu92nGgi2Y9tYOD.png","slug":"Chirag","joinTime":"2020-12-05T08:46:40+00:00","discussionCount":19,"commentCount":790,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-10-27T20:47:30+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"A random doge\n","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2119","attributes":{"title":"HostAris, OptikServers, CortexNodes, samm#9400 and J0SH#9586","slug":"2119-hostaris-optikservers-cortexnodes-samm9400-and-j0sh9586","isApproved":true}}]}

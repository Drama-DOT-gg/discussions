Like I said, it’s a free host. Not nasas space servers or whatever. I would have killed for a service like this as a kid just to be able to have a server with my friends. Everything runs smoothly when i dev there and works fine. No free trials I can confirm and no issues.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1293"}}}}]}

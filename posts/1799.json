(Keep in mind)</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few reasons why Rectrox (Rosey) should not be an owner.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>The Staff Team is in shambles: Rosey is hiring and firing people from executive roles on a daily basis.</li>\n<li>Support is trash, nobody knows how to do the job.</li>\n<li>Uptime is garbage, refer to screenshots for proof.</li>\n<li>Rosey doesn't know how to use WHMCS.</li>\n<li>Rosey is the only one with root access to all the servers and doesn't know how to do anything with them, they had to bring in the old owner to fix the issues.</li>\n<li>Rosey is the most immature child I have ever met, he quit from an executive position at Hye because he didn't want to pay for a bill in euros.</li>\n<li>He asked his parents for $1500 to buy Hye Hosting and he is \"14 Years Old\" (Sound like 10 in VC's)</li>\n<li>A good 50% of the general chat was saying \"Hye is dead\" and \"Hye has no potential\" after he took the company over.</li>\n<li>He tried to code a Discord bot for the company but \"Messed up a line of code\" and the bot deleted every single channel in the discord.</li></ol>\n\n<p>Final thoughts:</p>\n\n<p>Do not buy from Hye, sure it's cheap but if you refer to screenshots below uptime is trash. Rectrox (Rosey) the owner is very immature and not to be trusted. Support is trash, people have been waiting for 3 days with their server offline with no confirmation that it will come back. Overall Hye was once a great hosting (Under Ownership from Endermined) but now it is nothing like what it once was and it will probably die in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>I'm probably gonna get fired now :D</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading,<br>\nKloxified</p>\n\n<p>Screenshots of the uptime:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-14/1600126540-333680-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n","editedAt":"2020-09-27T16:30:33+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2803"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2803"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"83"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"1808"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2803","attributes":{"username":"Kloxified","displayName":"Kloxified","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Gwc0jSyuUKEdeCbX.png","slug":"Kloxified","joinTime":"2020-09-14T23:20:45+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":3,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2020-10-01T18:31:39+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"83","attributes":{"title":"SnowyHosting, BombHosting & OrbitNodes |  Rectrox/RoseyMC","slug":"83-snowyhosting-bombhosting-orbitnodes-rectroxroseymc","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"1808","attributes":{"number":11,"createdAt":"2020-09-15T00:54:19+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/83/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"1799\">Kloxified</a> No joke, but Hye without Ender is just a pile of garbage.

Neither are you promised amazing first-grade support. If you purchased their better support then the argument is of course valid.</li>\n<li>Secondly just pointing a subdomain on your parent company's domain to your free nodes doesn't mean you're selling those for money. That is even though \"eu-3.mcshosting.co.uk\" or whatever is pointed to the same IP as \"free2.freemc.host\" it doesn't mean the free node is being used for premium users. That could be the case but just pointing a domain does not mean it's concrete evidence.</li></ul>\n\n<p>That being said I think there's some valid criticism in this thread.<br>\nAnd again I don't want to discount anyone's argument I'm just throwing this out there so MCS isn't treated unfairly in regards to their prices &amp; business model.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Some things I agree with, like the fact that Nick hasn't shown us the pterodactyl stats yet</p>","editedAt":"2021-04-26T14:26:09+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2784"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2784"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"415"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2784","attributes":{"username":"europa","displayName":"europa","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/oXHOl1l6tlB1Ou4v.png","slug":"europa","joinTime":"2020-09-05T19:59:29+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":56,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-07-25T13:44:07+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"full stack dipshit","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"415","attributes":{"title":"NickE, MCS Hosting LTD & Over allocating.","slug":"415-nicke-mcs-hosting-ltd-over-allocating","isApproved":true}}]}

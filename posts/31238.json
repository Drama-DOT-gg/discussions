The point of this forum is not to post everywhere you can and post your discord link, it is exposing people. And what you have wrote about DBH, you haven't done a single bit of research and instead braindumped onto a discord message. Let me quote you on this you said here:</p> \n\n<p>\"How'd this happen? Dan | DBH#9700, the owner of DanBot Hosting was using an outdated version of pterodactyl. Guess what, the members were well aware what could've happened. They notified and kept telling Dan | DBH#9700, every single day for over 2 weeks! He didn't give a shit, he knew this would happen. He let thousands of his clients IPs, passwords, and even emails get leaked. ðŸ¤£\"</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in this thread, he updated one of his panels to the latest version. I agree he should have updated the other 3 however he just forgot as humans do and people don't know he has 4 panels for load balancing so were happy when he upgraded one. You then go on to say that the hacker got clients IPs and passwords. Now if you use that thing in your head called a brain, pterodactyl admin side gives you neither of those unless if the hacker accessed the MySQL database storing the passwords encrypted, which then the hacker would have to get the decryption key from the panels files which would need VPS access. Now if you again took the time to do a bit of research, nothing like VPSs was accessed. Same with IPs, that would need MySQL access if they use a MySQL session driver, or VPS access if they use a filesystem or redis session driver.</p>\n\n<p>Please do more research before just braindumping onto a discord server that you are advertising on this forum. It makes you look a bit silly to be honest.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1084"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_","joinTime":"2020-12-13T20:34:09+00:00","discussionCount":8,"commentCount":425,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-25T17:08:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1084","attributes":{"title":"DanBot Hosting Raided, Massive Data Leak","slug":"1084-danbot-hosting-raided-massive-data-leak","isApproved":true}}]}

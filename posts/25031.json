Some people/company might be providing good services and helpful for the community. Drama.gg isn't built for \"exposing companies and people using free domain\", it's meant to \"exposing <strong>fraudulent</strong> companies and people\" and I don't see any legal issue against free domain.</p> \n\n<p>When you should hoax a people/company using free domain?</p>\n<ul><li>unprofessional</li>\n<li>scamming</li>\n<li>shady link and transaction (such as through crypto currency which cannot be refund)</li>\n<li>illegal activities</li> </ul>\n\n<p>Should I use free domain?<br>\nI wouldn't recommend someone to do so if you have budget as your SEO and spam mail rate is high and in most cases you will not rank in the search engine and getting your mail at your customer spam folder.

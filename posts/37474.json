Showing a invoice with blurred info doesnt take a lot of time. Its just how is it on this fourm. I think you are new on this fourm so i will tell you this, Most hosts here that were deemed as free trial abusers have closed down, and there has been a couple of times where the owner provides valid proof and gets his thread locked and resolved(the resolved mark i think stops the thread from being indexed by search engines and stuff) from a moderator.I think there was a thread on how to report stuff but dont seem to find it. Threads here can be sometimes overexaggerated.</p>","editedAt":"2021-12-09T10:49:33+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3262"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3262"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1281"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3262","attributes":{"username":"Soul","displayName":"Soul","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/kWnM8aLFOe2uIpyb.png","slug":"Soul","joinTime":"2021-03-25T11:32:10+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":108,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-05-20T03:37:04+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"a idiot","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1281","attributes":{"title":"Xite Nodes Scam | Overloaded Nodes, Abusing Free trials, Ddosing other hosts, ","slug":"1281-xite-nodes-scam-overloaded-nodes-abusing-free-trials-ddosing-other-hosts","isApproved":true}}]}

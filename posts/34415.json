And not many ads.</p>   \n\n<p>And you would have gotten around 60% of the income depending on the size of the purchase (i.e you'll only get like 50% for a discord bot but 55%-60% for an 8GB MC server. Which is alot better than what the schutz guy gets), which is a good deal for you since you don't have to deal with websites, ads, getting users, etc, etc. You get the point.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1171/193\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"34365\">VolleierYouKnow</a></p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4739"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1171"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4739","attributes":{"username":"TheYeetster","displayName":"TheYeetster","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Bzg1ypsYeixFBMGH.png","slug":"TheYeetster","joinTime":"2021-10-29T17:14:08+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":146,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-03-12T21:57:04+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1171","attributes":{"title":"Watch out for Yeet Hosting","slug":"1171-watch-out-for-yeet-hosting","isApproved":true}}]}

Considering that they are collecting data and using data, they don't seem to be telling you how they store it and how safe your data really is. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-01/1633120667-327792-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<em>Above- A footer on the website where the legal documentation should be linked to be seen on every page but isn't</em></p>\n\n<p>After some digging, I found what \"appears\" to be their privacy policy and terms of conditions. But nope, its just a blank page.  Not to mention how difficult it actually was to find the legal information. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-01/1633120732-300167-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<em>Above- Blank legal documentation that isn't even hosted on their own domain</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Putting the legal issues aside, how reliable is their site, really? Their Discord server has a total of 200-300 members that are either inactive or active, which wouldn't be an issue if they weren't faking the voting statistics of their own bot. The bot is unverified but has 10k+ votes? Their site doesn't have good or any SEO and it has 10k+ votes. Something is just not adding up here.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-01/1633120551-659365-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<em>Above- Statistics of the bot on their website</em><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-01/1633120598-953714-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<em>Above- Their bot in Discord</em></p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3821"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1062"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3821","attributes":{"username":"Will","displayName":"Will","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/DRViQXWTG5mdeaL6.png","slug":"Will","joinTime":"2021-06-16T13:14:02+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":32,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-10-02T06:56:33+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1062","attributes":{"title":"Discordland.gg, what could go wrong?","slug":"1062-discordlandgg-what-could-go-wrong","isApproved":true}}]}

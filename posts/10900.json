This is the logic of Falix apparently, you can't criticize shit in there, \"bad bavior with management/staff team\" doesn't make any sense at all.. I was expressing on how fucking retarded their promotion system works, apparently, they promote those who are \"ready and capable\" yeah, even those with fucking braindead spellings/grammatical mistakes, oops yeah I forgot some wolfy guy was promoted to support team cause chimken approached this little retard and said \"You're going to make a great addition\".. fucking seriously? This idiot keeps typing in \"XD XD\"\" has grammatical mistakes, spelling mistakes, and a lot of other shit, tbh I wouldn't even be surprised as they have a 13 year old staff member Ashutosh Kumar, he was promoted because he solved 1000 tickets cool, This kid has a lot of fucking grammar mistakes and spelling mistakes like wolfy, tends to forget the rules and makes his own rules which happened a lot before Falix got raided, anyways I'mma end this right here because I feel retarded even trying to comprehend Falix's logic like seriously, improve your management system ffs.</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3386"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"10903"},{"type":"posts","id":"10906"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3386","attributes":{"username":"Turnip","displayName":"Turnip","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/e9sBP3RxaPGMWVjR.png","slug":"Turnip","joinTime":"2021-04-14T10:05:12+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":17,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-02-27T14:41:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2801","attributes":{"username":"DeadBush","displayName":"DeadBush","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/XbjcjyJPwRXjAX5J.png","slug":"DeadBush"}},{"type":"users","id":"3175","attributes":{"username":"ely","displayName":"ely","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/uQHlc6TKjTtLggmz.png","slug":"ely"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"34","attributes":{"title":"Lamaker/ItzAwesome/Lily/Pamar | FalixNodes/Falix.gg & PrimeSRV","slug":"34-lamakeritzawesomelilypamar-falixnodesfalixgg-primesrv","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"10903","attributes":{"number":870,"createdAt":"2021-04-14T10:26:54+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/34/869\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"10900\">Turnip</a> and I got demoted for keeping facts lmfao</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2801"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"10906","attributes":{"number":872,"createdAt":"2021-04-14T12:44:44+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/34/869\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"10900\">Turnip</a> You were muted mainly for the fact that you speak bad of a certain group or country, which  consider as xenophobia.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3175"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}}]}

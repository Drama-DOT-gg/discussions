All EU citizens are entitled to a 14 day refund policy by law, which must be respected by every company providing online services. Oh and the client is in no way required to give a justification for the refund. EU law states a refund must be given without a reason if the service/item has been in use for less than 14 days.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3132"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2069"}}}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1759","attributes":{"userId":6960,"postId":49143,"reactionId":1}}]}

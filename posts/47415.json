What I can say, is mostly that every user data is not secure and could be even accessed by the staff, horrible. Imagine not having a data protection officer in a stand and let him only access the data.</p>\n\n\n<p>Now, Innocent, you may answer his question.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6253"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1919"}}}}]}

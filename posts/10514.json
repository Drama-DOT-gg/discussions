And if you say that HiveMC biggest bedrock server read their rules no one follow their rules and still roams in the server. Rules can be broken sometimes but you guys straight up ban people for breaking rules even once. And I have ss of your owner saying the guy to say good thing about the server or he will be banned. Its like clearly saying Thief blames other thief for stealing the money he stole from others</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3358"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"359"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"10519","attributes":{"number":77,"createdAt":"2021-04-10T08:35:56+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/359/74\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"10514\">Axel229</a> and your owner ays he or she is 19 years old right.

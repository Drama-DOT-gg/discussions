I personally think that the owner needs to learn how to run a company better he's really strange and aggressive most of the time. He lies to customers plenty and fails to provide simple information etc. If I tell much more my identity will be revealed but overall I'd just use a different company.. I'll try to provide as much as I can but for now what I can say is limited for privacy reasons.</p>\n\n<p>I do feel that <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/154/54\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"4529\">Detective_Alpha</a> should have been given a warning of some sort instead of immediately resorting to demoting him but Alpha has done a lot of bad things such as slandering other companies and stealing assets and arguing with other company owners for no reason.</p>\n\n<p>Jay has also slandered other company names for using equal hardware to them and is an odd person overall.</p>\n\n<p>Tilted Hosting is no better though, they've had a pretty bad background in general. For your safety, please just stay far away from both Navo Hosting and Tilted Hosting.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3021"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"154"}}}}]}

Was going to let me have a happy birthday (i even pinged everyone to tell them to say a happy bday to you) and i was gonna demote you for pinging everyone for a YT vids for kids but i let it slide because its your bday and i let it slide into the point i need to involve on drama.gg??</p>\n\n<p>Your behavior is going ridiculous. Looks like a meeting is gonna be held because of you ruining mehost rep with a joke which isnt a joke</p>\n\n\n<p>If mehost is a talking community you mentioning everyone for a yt vid is totally reasonable but this is a host and a yt video have nothing related to hosting.</p>","editedAt":"2021-09-05T23:08:20+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3322"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3322"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"962"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"27126"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3322","attributes":{"username":"dchu096","displayName":"dchu096","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/wVyxBypjNtCmvWOv.png","slug":"dchu096","joinTime":"2021-04-05T07:43:38+00:00","discussionCount":6,"commentCount":757,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-05-19T20:18:02+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"OSQxiWmdoWy3AcIk.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3560","attributes":{"username":"Ryan","displayName":"Ryan","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/kupiyTaJLdJ9sXo5.png","slug":"Ryan"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"962","attributes":{"title":"Zachery<-ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‚ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ#0007 | Twilight client | Requesting Ddos Attacks","slug":"962-zachery-0007-twilight-client-requesting-ddos-attacks","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"27126","attributes":{"number":34,"createdAt":"2021-09-06T16:51:15+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/962/14\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27064\">dchu096</a> if a mod will look into this he might as well just add confirmed tag, the reason why MeHost was mentioned is <br>\n1- because Zach has (or had) a high position in your staff team, idk about u guys but am careful before i hire someone that clearly suck at doing his job.<br>\n2- he offered me staff in MeHost, idc if he has or doesn't have the authority to do so, but he did, ur fault for hiring him. <br>\nAnd Cmon Zach Didn't say that because he thought am a good staff member he doesn't know shit about me he said he worked with me before, but i have no memory of it so it either i have severe memory loss, or Zach is lying, and with zach's past guess which option is more likely ? <br>\nam not  removing this thread or editing the title, if you want to make ur host better get better staff, and don't hire brain-dead kids.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3560"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"962"}}}}]}

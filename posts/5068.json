I later got an email saying I could never use Contabo again, I decided to take this as a loss and ask for the servers to be put back up for data to be restored. They did so without a fuss.</p> \n\n<p>I was encouraged by some people to leave a bad review, and so I did. A couple hours later I got this email from the Contabo Billing Department</p> \n\n<p>They were trying to bribe me for me to remove my review, despite saying I can not use their services. As we all know - companies trying to bribe clients info removing reviews is strictly forbidden under Trustpilot's ToS - so I decided to play along. And golly, they actually refunded me.</p> \n\n<p>Yea, so that's the story so far. I'll keep this thread updated as I plan on emailing Trustpilot's team.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/QDQ81Q3\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/QDQ81Q3</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/yXX1VLW\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/yXX1VLW</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/gmnPnNY\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/gmnPnNY</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/bH8v3bK\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/bH8v3bK</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/f9YhZkd\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/f9YhZkd</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/44bcBXb\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/44bcBXb</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/r3TQtYY\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/r3TQtYY</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/tPm14GN\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/tPm14GN</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/Yh2JJzf\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/Yh2JJzf</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/34gbRNN\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/34gbRNN</a></p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2785"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"168"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"5083"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2785","attributes":{"username":"Akash_","displayName":"Akash_","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Akash_","joinTime":"2020-09-05T21:07:56+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":10,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-04-27T18:42:45+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"80","attributes":{"username":"JAY","displayName":"JAY","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"JAY"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"168","attributes":{"title":"Contabo - We'll bribe you into removing your review.","slug":"168-contabo-well-bribe-you-into-removing-your-review","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"5083","attributes":{"number":6,"createdAt":"2021-01-25T08:53:42+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/168/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"5068\">Akash_</a> tip don't go with them in general</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"80"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"168"}}}}]}

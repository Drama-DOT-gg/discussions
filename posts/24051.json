Banning and removing accounts for no reson. Also cant afford more nodesand are keeping 2 overloaded nodes lmao</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I'm gonna post the message that I was sending but it was being deleted and ignored by toxic, here it is:<br>\nSo, the whole argument started because of the problems with the roles. Someone had the role \"Swedish\" and got warned because of it meanwhile no one else got warned for having a Turkish role while not being turkish. Then the war started. Community manager was literally dong nothing to the community for the whole time. Simply, mods were doing the dirty job for him when it comes to moderating or taking care of the community. Scoopy and aaron were saying what he was doing. Both of them were trying to improve this server. They were treatning everyone equally. If someone wasn't turkish they werent warning him. If someone wasnt swedish they werent warning him. I even took all of the roles and after 1 day only role swedish was removed from me meanwhile turkish stayed. Okay, they might've done some things without your permission but these things were to help the server and not do destroy it. When scoopy became and admin he wanted to make this server look more user-friendly. They put all they could to help this server. They were constantly active. Swedish role is like a \"vip\" role because most of your paying customers are from there. Sure, they can be but make a special role for them like @Payer or @Supporter or something and then make this role \"exclusive\" instead of making a public role. Scoopy offered a change in of text in #roles-roller but nothing has changed. @Gamer Omega#1234 and <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/KA1\" class=\"UserMention\">@KA1</a> were told to make their nicknames \"mentionable\" meanwhile they were. Every single nickname is mentionable. Not our problem that you dont know that you can do right click -&gt; mention or &lt;@user_id&gt;. But then, what about the other people being \"unmentionable\" and still nothing is being done to them? @! furki#2336 for example or @.LilNoya#2021. This is really unfair to users and everyone should be treated equally. Target only 1 country and do with them whatever you want but if you're also targetting other countries treat everyone equally. That were my last words, do whatever you want to me now but dont delete this message</p>\n\n<p>Also \"community manager\" was so much caring about the community that didnt even know what hashtag #UserRightsMatter meant. Not talking about how you dont exactly know what you can do or not since they'll come up with the last \"rule\" that says \"staff are the law\"</p>","editedAt":"2021-08-19T09:40:31+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4197"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4197"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"890"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"26179"}]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"816"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4197","attributes":{"username":"Cnnn666","displayName":"Cnnn666","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/PMgsY1ldkzME4yFO.png","slug":"Cnnn666","joinTime":"2021-08-17T22:29:29+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":184,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-03-25T15:14:58+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"scamplox","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4320","attributes":{"username":"Pajsen","displayName":"Pajsen","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/WZ27vHRxyK6TlLxq.png","slug":"Pajsen"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"890","attributes":{"title":"Sweplox Hosting | Low Quality Service","slug":"890-sweplox-hosting-low-quality-service","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"26179","attributes":{"number":571,"createdAt":"2021-08-28T23:28:45+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/890/2\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"24051\">Cnnn666</a> Do you know how expensive servers are? We got donor 2 when donor 1 was overloaded. I've also tried to improve the server. But we have a voting system for changed we want to make. They changed stuff without permission. We have a role called Kunder (it means Costumers). We didn't just target the Swedish role. But it says \"Pick your region\" and not \"Pick any role you want\". Our community manger was working and wasn't online very much. The \"#UsersRightsMatter\" is a very rude comparison against \"#BlackLifeMatters\", it's very disrespectful how you dare compare racism to a role.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4320"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"890"}}}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"816","attributes":{"userId":4196,"postId":24051,"reactionId":15}}]}

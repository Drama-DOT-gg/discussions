I asked you to remove all traces of my email, name, IP and whatnot, but literally on the 13th (4 days after I was fired) I decided to change it because I remembered you kept Voll's proxy IP's even like half a year later. You do realize IP spoofing or inspect element on your part exists. Also I didn't create any accounts, that was once again, Voll, and since I see you have \"logs\", you should be able to check that, wouldn't you.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4739"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}}}}]}

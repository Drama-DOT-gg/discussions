That's just my opinion. However, I don't believe it's a good idea to state that in a business environment. If someone was lgbt, I would still serve them with the same respect as a normal customer as that's no concern to me in business, and doesn't violate any polices. All customers are equal.</p>","editedAt":"2020-09-21T19:57:18+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"57"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"57"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"88"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"2194"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"57","attributes":{"username":"MCKingSam","displayName":"MCKingSam","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Z8yMtBEBje96YyBu.png","slug":"MCKingSam","joinTime":"2020-08-01T18:23:42+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":47,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-03-17T00:51:26+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"63","attributes":{"username":"Jen","displayName":"Jen","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/nEonNSnQZxgu2J1i.png","slug":"Jen"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"88","attributes":{"title":"Holo Hosting LLC","slug":"88-holo-hosting-llc","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"2194","attributes":{"number":139,"createdAt":"2020-09-21T19:56:46+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/88/138\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"2193\">MCKingSam</a> I don't refuse service to people if they are gay<br>\nAll i said was I'm Anti LGBTQ<br>\nI never said I would fucking refuse to serve them</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"63"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"88"}}}}]}

How about YOU go do some research. FiveM is currently in lawsuits with Rockstar, because they do indeed still care.

If rockstar wanted to come after them again, another class action lawsuit would be filed, attacking FiveM's use of the files made to replicate the game. Therefor, yes, reselling FiveM servers is against Rockstar's terms of service. It's also against FiveM's terms of service, due to the fact they have a brand deal with Zap-Hosting. None of what I just said, should be reasons to attack individuals that resell fivem server hosting. FiveM is the perpetrator here. If you don't want it to be resold, don't allow it to be sold in the first place. Pierce doesn't even personally offer FiveM anymore, and was planning to stop offering it as is.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3081"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"180"}}}}]}

I recommend shockbyte, they have a very good support team and they respond quickly, I didn't experience any downtime yet. But sometimes their CPU is kinda slow. But yea I can assure you personally shockbyte is good. If you know how to configure or setup ubuntu, well it'll be better if you rent a machine from OVH, But they do not accept sms/gcash payment. Shockbyte do. ðŸ™‚<br>\nJust wanna help the owners/servers that got scammed by Enfernee.

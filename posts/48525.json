You can clearly tell its a VM/VPS. Here's how:</p>\n\n<p>Proxmox always lists cores then CPU. For example under CPU(s) it shows 4x AMD Ryzen 7 2700x Eight-Core Processor. <br>\nThe \"4x\" is how many cores this proxmox instance has. If this was really a dedicated server it should show either \"8x\" or \"16x\" (Sometimes in older versions of proxmox, threads are seen as cores)<br>\nFor example: here is theirs <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-18/1660808559-188381-image.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"image\"> <br>\nAnd here is one of my proxmox testing dedicated servers: <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LOxcFul.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"image\"><br>\nYou can see theirs says 4cores for a 8core 16thread processor, while mine shows 64cores for a 64core processor. <br>\n<em>Also just in case they try to say the system is running things, My proxmox testing dedicated server has 1 VM running,  on a HDD. yet IO delay is still at 0.00% while theirs is at 0.06%</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Also looking at it, That proxmox install has nothing running on it (Or very little, by the ram usage) yet the IO delay is 0.06%. This amount of load, that IO delay should be 0.00% or 0.01%. meaning its probably running as a VM with a hard drive.</p> \n\n<p>Following on this, after looking at their discord server, in budget-vps their highest tier VPS has 16cores, on a 32core/64thread system. basically meaning if more than 2people buy that plan, their systems would be so easily overloaded. (If both users were to be power hungry and eat up all the CPU usage)<br>\nMeaning you would be paying for something that is way overallocated and will eventually grind to a hault.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone has a site for this host, please do link it below as i would like to look a bit more into this.</p> \n\n<p><em>Please note i have not tried this host, Just wanting to point out some information for users who may pass upon this post later down the line and not know much about how proxmox or system-admin stuff works.</em></p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4627"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2010"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"48526"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4627","attributes":{"username":"Dan1","displayName":"Dan1","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/w7Ob5PtfEKcqDAOn.png","slug":"Dan1","joinTime":"2021-10-15T09:32:17+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":25,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-01-06T21:37:38+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"6736","attributes":{"username":"WhiteDreamDev","displayName":"WhiteDreamDev","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/YxyauZLqrGmJXL4f.png","slug":"WhiteDreamDev"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2010","attributes":{"title":"HassleVPS | Free VPS |","slug":"2010-hasslevps-free-vps","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"48526","attributes":{"number":9,"createdAt":"2022-08-19T07:47:57+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2010/8\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"48525\">Dan1</a></p>\n\n<p>Heyy üëãüèª , Hello I would like to tell you that that image was from testing, now we have our own server in a special location in Moldova with 16 Cores. Until we have an official website, we want to buy a domain and we will start, if you want to know more about HassleVPS you can enter our discord!

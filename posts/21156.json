He's also dumb as fuck, and got mad at the base resources of centronodes. He didn't listen to the people in the quackhost server when they said that he'd be receiving extra resources to compensate for less resources than what he had in qh, but he didn't pay heed to that. All he kept saying was how his servers were ruined and he needed more.</p>\n\n<p>Wow! Hiring random people in some hosting discord server!

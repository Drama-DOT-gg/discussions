You guys are 12 y/o. You cannot take legal action for anything that happens and you can also not afford to start a hosting company at the age of 12 without scamming people or stealing your parents money. 12 y/o's don't even know the basics of sys admin or anything, you're too inexperienced and simply can't afford to have a hosting company so just don't until you get way older and learn a lot about the industry. <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/PugRug\" class=\"UserMention\">@PugRug</a> ^</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"104"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"173"}}}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"404","attributes":{"userId":3531,"postId":13579,"reactionId":1}}]}

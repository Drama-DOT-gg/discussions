You brag on about it every fucking day. The only reason you're paying back is because you're worried ill winterhoax you for everything i know about you. Its not because you're a nice person. What about mario? Without him you would never of managed to make falix. The problem i have with you is you always act like falix was 100% made by you which is fucking bullshit. Without me and mario falix wouldn't exist, and you should accept that.</p>"},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"96","attributes":{"userId":7,"postId":4749,"reactionId":3}}]}

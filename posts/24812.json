I needed a logo to complete my website which at the time used WordPress. You have to understand, unlike most people on this forum, I'm not a child and I don't have unlimited free time. I have stuff to do &amp; places to be, I can't sit around for hours on hours &amp; days straight making my own logo, coding my entire website, etc, on a computer. I'm sorry to hear that you're not happy with my website.<br>\nIn regards to what you said above, yes, I did change stuff on my website after screenshots were taken. I took the rather <em>harsh</em> advice and changed my website accordingly. Additionally, In no way am I evading taxes under any circumstance. I made that text larger on the Sitefold website as it appears you were not happy with it. If you have any more suggestions, I'm always open to hear them, but if you are going to give me suggestions in an impudent way, I won't appreciate that very much.</p>\n\n\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4223"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"899"}}}}]}

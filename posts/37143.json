Here, think about this,</p> \n\n<p>If you trademarked the name \"AllSafe\", and someone copied it and \"is\" using it, then you proceed to say <br>\n<code>this is trademarked, please change it</code>. But they say <code>no, because it isn't illegal to copy it and use it.</code></p> \n\n<p>Yet it is, its the same example here. Trademarks are LEGAL documents, same thing with Privacy Policy's and Terms of Service.</p>\n\n<p>This is ALL on the Copyright Law. Please read online about anything law, before you come onto a thread and talk about it.

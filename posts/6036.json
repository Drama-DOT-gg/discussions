You are stepping on unknown territory, I suggest doing something else with your life due to the fact that you clearly can't run a host for more than a week without shutting it down. You have called out other hosting providers which provide quality that is unmatched to the quality of Ice Hosting. You are not in any position to do so.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3036"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"191"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"6043"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3036","attributes":{"username":"Vanquish","displayName":"Vanquish","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/fggUflkAbpVpGb63.png","slug":"Vanquish","joinTime":"2021-01-24T17:51:40+00:00","discussionCount":14,"commentCount":360,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-06-02T04:07:54+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"i do stuff","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"191","attributes":{"title":"\"Ice Hosting\" Sketchy (BabyAces) (IceHosting is fine)","slug":"191-ice-hosting-sketchy-babyaces-icehosting-is-fine","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"6043","attributes":{"number":65,"createdAt":"2021-02-07T01:45:59+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/191/58\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"6036\">Vanquish</a></p> \n\n<p>Hello Vanquish,<br>\n     Your last comment/post seemed to have some sort of hostile intentions towards him himself and not Ice Hosting, Which is off-topic, Would you mind going back on topic?

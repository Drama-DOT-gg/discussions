However, copying terms of service and privacy policy isn't illegal at all, therefore you couldn't take any legal action on him (including DMCA). I also spotted changes on the terms of service which they changed your company name to their company name and he know what he is doing, this is definitely a valid terms of service. The point of terms of service is provide service and trust to your customer, not about fighting who copy your terms of service. You should be happy of someone copy your terms of service, it's a sign that you are an example that he like.</p>\n\n<p>But I am aware of the motion of this thread is trying to asking someone to apologies for nothing wrong on him and his company, I could tell you wanted him to mention( or advertise) your host in their statement and do unnecessary apologies. You also mentioned that he was your staff and you are happy for him of starting out his own host, now you are being a hypocrite and fighting over terms of service and privacy policy. At this point, I feel very sad about him for being your staff and helping you. Your ungratefulness show how childish you are and the ugly part of your company, CygenNodes.com.</p> \n\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nAllSafe</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5010"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1269"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"4246"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"37042"},{"type":"posts","id":"37141"},{"type":"posts","id":"37143"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"5010","attributes":{"username":"AllSafe","displayName":"AllSafe","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"AllSafe","joinTime":"2021-12-06T12:26:34+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":98,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-12-13T13:32:16+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4246","attributes":{"username":"TTEG_Unbox","displayName":"TTEG_Unbox","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"TTEG_Unbox"}},{"type":"users","id":"4857","attributes":{"username":"__SECRET__","displayName":"__SECRET__","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/AOVen6htNOjlCTXk.png","slug":"__SECRET__"}},{"type":"users","id":"4917","attributes":{"username":"Sky","displayName":"Sky","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/cS8vcbRYULJjEZTr.png","slug":"Sky"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1269","attributes":{"title":"ThunderHost/FS Hosting: Stealing Terms of Service from CygenNodes.com","slug":"1269-thunderhostfs-hosting-stealing-terms-of-service-from-cygennodescom","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"37042","attributes":{"number":8,"createdAt":"2021-12-07T04:38:06+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1269/6\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"36957\">AllSafe</a> So you mean to say that according to you if someone copies your legal documents which you made yourself then its fine? Now imagine this: you Work on a project very hard. You research, think and make that yourself and then suddenly someone just copies that project and gets good marks for it and people appreciate that fellow who copied your hard work.

Here, think about this,</p> \n\n<p>If you trademarked the name \"AllSafe\", and someone copied it and \"is\" using it, then you proceed to say <br>\n<code>this is trademarked, please change it</code>. But they say <code>no, because it isn't illegal to copy it and use it.</code></p> \n\n<p>Yet it is, its the same example here. Trademarks are LEGAL documents, same thing with Privacy Policy's and Terms of Service.</p>\n\n<p>This is ALL on the Copyright Law. Please read online about anything law, before you come onto a thread and talk about it.

What is this? Like the 3rd?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rocket/Rectrox/RoseyMC or “Gavin M” co-owned/owned SnowyHosting and BombHosting.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Note: Rocket changed their account to BabyAces#2765 (ID: 800131315244204053)</p> \n\n<p><strong>#### THE START ####</strong></p>\n\n<p>I (Spinge) was a manager at both Snowy and Bomb. But I left not too long after Bomb was created because there was drama, constantly.</p>\n\n<p>Reasons why Rocket shouldn't own a host, or anything at all:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>He hired shitty staff through a shitty application and then whined about it, claiming he got \"very depressed\".</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Is never involved with the community</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If you dare to hurt his very fragile ego, you'll get instantly silenced and most probably, banned. I was banned more than a few times, but thankfully I have good ties with one of the other owners at Bomb &amp; Snowy.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>He doesn't know how to manage shit. The Discord server looks like trash, the website looks like trash, the panel looks trash, and so on.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Prioritized publicity over quality: He had a lot of J4R, Invite rewards, etc. and many clients weren't getting their stuff because noone responded to tickets, when I told him I can make some bot that can interact with the Pterodactyl panel, he ignored me.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Poor at managing anything, he is always promising but never delivering.</p></li> </ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>#### STORY/HISTORY ####</strong></p>\n\n<p>After Edward owned the Snowy Discord server for a while, Rocket &amp; RusJS (Read the sidenote further down the doc for more info about RusJS) wanted more. Rus &amp; Rocket/Rosey pressured him to give them the ownership over the server, which he accepted because of the pressure.</p>\n\n<p>After realising what he did, he tried to getting it back.</p>\n\n<p>It took like a whole 24 hours of arguing, ignorance, racism, etc. to get a deal. The deal was that Edward should get ownership back when Snowy will reach 1K members, which it did, a week or two later.</p>\n\n<p>When trying to convince Rus to hand back the ownership, he tried to ignore it as much as possible, and he only gave it back when a lot of damage was done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rocket Himself</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rocket is a negligent, racist egoist.<br>\nHe hired really bad staff for both Bomb &amp; Snowy and later complained and whined about it.</p>\n\n<p>He called me a Nazi 4 times because I said that I was Russian. [meaning his history is like... completely fucked up?]</p>\n\n<p>If you dare to hurt his very fragile ego, you will, as mentioned previously, get silenced and most likely, banned.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edward went to start a new host with Rocket known as Bomb, which Rocket now wants to get ownership of too because, as he claims, the support is terrible, when HE was the one who hired the support through a shitty application with stupid questions that were not related to anything.</p>\n\n<p>We were also sorta bribed not to tell anyone about the happenings in the group chat (in which this all happened)</p> \n\n<p>The bribe was \"you can keep the nodes as long as you don't leak\" - he was also quite racist in the group and had a thing for attacking people based on where they came from.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The threat was always to turn off the nodes.</strong>  When no one listened to him, he turned them off. Everyone was messing around, turned them off. People told him to get Rus to hand ownership back, he turned the nodes off.</p> \n\n<p>To the very (what seemed) little power he had, had a very big impact on the thoughts of customers. It was quite unprofessional.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>#### SIDENOTE ####</strong></p>\n\n<p>Soon after the drama at Bomb, Rocket decided to nuke the server and the nodes too. We banned Rus too, but apparently he came back later with proof, that Rocket was threatening to ruin his reputation, which is quite ironic, someone with terrible rep is trying to ruin someone else's rep.</p> \n\n<p>Rocket also had a no fun policy everywhere, I've seen actual companies that got more laid back policies.</p> \n\n<p>Also, once he left these places he removed the servers and made it a real mess, then the blames shifted to people like Rus &amp; Edward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>#### SCAMMING ####</strong><br>\nRocket also seemed to have scammed someone and then refused to refund them when they didn't receive their resources that they got promised</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792779875416014868/802656102101024768/IMG_20210123_234824.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792779875416014868/802656102101024768/IMG_20210123_234824.png</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792779875416014868/802656102311133204/IMG_20210123_234753.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792779875416014868/802656102311133204/IMG_20210123_234753.png</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792779875416014868/802656102436700190/IMG_20210123_234550.jpg\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792779875416014868/802656102436700190/IMG_20210123_234550.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792779875416014868/802656102641696798/IMG_20210123_234657.jpg\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792779875416014868/802656102641696798/IMG_20210123_234657.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>#### CONCLUSION ####</strong></p>\n\n<p>Do not rely on hosts where Rocket is staff or anything like that.

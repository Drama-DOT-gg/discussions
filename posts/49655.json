A ex-staff member of Windows Support Community, I joined just today to talk about WSC (Windows Support Community), they have really bad owners even sabotaging an another server called Windows 11 Community which I am no longer co-owner of after that server got deleted.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to mention what they've pulled that got Windows 11 Community deleted.</p>\n\n<p>First Issue - One of the admins of WSC pretty much spit in one of the W11C staff's face because an another bot (Tickets) has a similar function. Which they wanted replaced, we got pissed and straight up called them out. The staff member was a developer hence why they got pissed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/861142164074135613/861151785188458496/Screenshot_20210704-004922.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855562077128359947/1058633190278971464/Screenshot_20221231-012338_Discord.jpg\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 2</a></p>\n\n<p>Second Issue - The same admin posted an invite to their server, Windows Support Community back when it was Windows Community which reached 50 members in a week because they stole members from our server. Here's the thing, he wasn't a booster and staff aren't allowed to post their own ad in the booster promo channel. When he did this, people started going to this server so we called the dude out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/861142164074135613/861152534605594644/Screenshot_20210704-003446.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/861142164074135613/861145693200056360/Screenshot_20210704-002525.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 2 (The owner inviting the staff member)</a></p>\n\n<p>Screenshot 2 of Issue #1 is also a role of this issue.</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards, after the server got banned. More issues started appearing, like they've been redistributing modified copies of Windows 10 and they've been getting bad staff, one of the staff of WSC became a co-owner in 2 months when I was Junior Moderator for 2 months before I got banned.</p>\n\n<p>First Issue - Wingamo Devs and their modded copies of Windows. Long story short, My ideas kept getting stolen and arguments kept happening which got me banned for no reason.</p>\n\n<p>Second Issue (Part 1) - Members being toxic, especially the owners and Windows 7 users. Literally, I was doing my job moderating and some dude was telling others to downgrade to Windows 7 because Windows 10/11 sucks and we kept saying stop and they wouldn't stop so I had to ban that member.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/996112715024175104/Screenshot_2022-07-11-20-56-02-17_572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 1 (Taken by a friend of mine)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/997581860613918762/Screenshot_2022-07-15-22-14-02-38_572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 2 (Taken by the same person)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/997909990151041024/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/997911445025071224/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 4 (I had to find a way to tell the person to stop)</a></p>\n\n<p>NOTE: The first 2 screenshots are taken by TheDieMargus, the arabic name is the troublemaker.</p>\n\n<p>Second Issue (Part 2) - More users keep telling others to use older software which isn't safe for your computer and could possibly have a virus. This was also where I had a mental breakdown because of some trolls in an another server.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/997911445025071224/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/1001921141054640198/Screenshot_2022-07-27-21-36-45-14_572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 2</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/1001935233173696693/Screenshot_20220727-1532312.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/1002182688565895230/Screenshot_20220728_075301.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">The co-owner's pettiness - Image 1 (The person who got promoted in 2 months)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/1003355622475038841/Screenshot_20220731_133525.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">The co-owner's pettiness - Image 2</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/1003355622894473296/Screenshot_20220731_132428.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">The co-owner's pettiness - Image 3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/1003359478609092638/Screenshot_20220731_133617.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Me calling out the co-owner</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/1015774248851214417/Screenshot_20220903-2003192.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Statement from my friend SilverTool</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fg5GHCNWIAAoFji?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Statement from Callistemon</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fg5GHL8WYAAmY1U?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">What TheDieMargus said about the situtation</a></p>\n\n<p>Screenshots of the owner being a douche:<br>\n<a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fg5GIqxXgAEANSm?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fg5GIzmXkAAUZSJ?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">2</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fg5GJVAXEAIPZTE?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fg5GJljXgAAWg7f?format=jpg&amp;name=small\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">4</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fg5GJvRXkAEoEME?format=jpg&amp;name=medium\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">5 (dude actually did make fun of my mental health)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855562077128359947/1015614542501384253/Screenshot_20220903-0928002.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">6 (Most of the arguments were caused by the staff)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855562077128359947/1003840712175013940/IMG_0465.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">7 (the co-owner lied about this)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855562077128359947/1035911066108051486/Screenshot_20221029-0939582.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">8 (rubbing the members they got into my face)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855562077128359947/1040775117271212042/Screenshot_20221111-1847432.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">9 (lying even though he's online almost all of the fuckin time)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855562077128359947/1040775536500289656/Screenshot_20221111-1849322.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">10 (ignored the listen to members part)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855562077128359947/1040795491690102855/Screenshot_20221111-2009052.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">11 (banned because you are immature jesus)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855562077128359947/1041011557146046464/Screenshot_20221112-1025462.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">The owner being a retard</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855562077128359947/1042245896831774740/Screenshot_20221115-1206202.png?width=509&amp;height=666\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Owner making excuses - Image 1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/855562077128359947/1042245897154732042/Screenshot_20221115-1209412.png?width=559&amp;height=666\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Owner making excuses - Image 2</a></p>\n\n<p>NOTE: I was still recovering from depression too at the time hence why I got banned, I'm mostly recovered now but this is why I decided to notify this site and anyone else about this server to protect themselves from bad staff and tech supporters.

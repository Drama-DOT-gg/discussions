He came telling us that it broke the TOS of the peer-to-peer service, ARC.io, to which we answered no, also here is the explanation, the dash after a time of being inactive is automatically removed from the AFK page. Also, I think that the EpikHost service has something against us, since I have not seen them approach larger services like CentralNodes (Very good service), saying the same thing. If the protection of the AFK page is not enough, we are working on a game for the same page so that it stops being completely AFK.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding our so-called 'free trial', we have paid for the Ares node to an external provider (35 dollars a month) that he does completely use said service (Azure) and that I do not think it is free trial. We do NOT use free trial, and we have another node on the way, but it is not from the external provider if that is the problem.</p>\n\n<p>I do not know why the owners of EpikHost resent us so much if we have not done anything to any community in general, we are simply a small hosting company like any other.</p>\n\n<p>The person who uploaded this post without arguments, came to our discord server breaking 3 main rules of our discord channel, and although we told him to contact us by e-mail (<a href=\"mailto:support@spiralnodes.xyz\">support@spiralnodes.xyz</a>) he did not do so since I guess I wanted to do this post. Which I honestly do not understand why.</p>\n\n<p>Please, people of EpikHost, I simply ask that you respect us as a company and that you stop treating us as less simply because we are smaller, I put the example again of CentralNodes, I invite you to make a complete report of CentralNodes. (We have nothing against anyone, including mentioned services)</p>\n\n<p>Hiro, SpiralNodes.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4368"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1128"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"30"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"31786"},{"type":"posts","id":"31789"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4368","attributes":{"username":"HiroBeet","displayName":"HiroBeet","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/QpWNosgCMMp2ncf1.png","slug":"HiroBeet","joinTime":"2021-09-02T10:32:39+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":12,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-02-19T15:56:13+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"30","attributes":{"username":"Triassic","displayName":"Triassic","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/vpuY80JJaf7LHX7q.png","slug":"Triassic"}},{"type":"users","id":"4443","attributes":{"username":"PolyAnthi","displayName":"PolyAnthi","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/lJQqj8C8YMv4iisj.png","slug":"PolyAnthi"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1128","attributes":{"title":"SpiralNodes (spiralnodes.xyz) - Using Free Trials and Denying AFK Page","slug":"1128-spiralnodes-spiralnodesxyz-using-free-trials-and-denying-afk-page","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"31786","attributes":{"number":9,"createdAt":"2021-10-20T17:41:15+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1128/7\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"31784\">HiroBeet</a> Sorry I mentioned ´CentralNodes´ and is ´CentroNodes´ actually.

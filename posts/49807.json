Sole proprietorship is perfectly legal as you stated. You are also right that my parents would be liable, however I've started this with their consent and they are actually fairly involved and informed when I'm doing something. (Not that it'll matter much longer as I'm almost 18).</p> \n\n<p>I will not be addressing Yeetster nor Voll directly as it will only give them what they want. If anyone wants more information on these accusations you may message me directly on Discord and I will answer any questions to the best of my ability. However I do request you keep it mature, I'm not looking to argue or fight with random people ðŸ˜„</p> \n\n <p>Discord: Pengu#3221</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7096"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}}}}]}

It depends on the processing power if they can handle the amount of server or not.<br>\n2) They are just dumb, they should use calculator instead of using 2000 MB (1.72 GB) if they put 2048 MB (2.00 GB) You will get the resource u bought. Same answers with storage too!<br>\n3) Well.. about the storage issues, is it alot already for small servers. But, if you really need high storage you gotta request one. <br>\nWell im not gonna complain about the price since it matches already with the plans.<br>\n4) If they got a lot of freaking grammar/spelling mistakes, then they are a kid who owns a hosting. And yeah about the privacy policy. \"DaryNodes have rights to erase anyone's data without any information or update given to the community\" its absolutely ridiculous and its making people mad.</p>\n\n<p>This hosting is really not recommended.<br>\nAlso, give me the server invite link.

What makes me hesitate, maybe a free trial?</p>\n\n<p>I met one of your clients, who decided to withdraw his service because supposedly they put his vps in maintenance and never delivered it again</p>\n\n<p>Is this how ApestCloud treats its users, just wondering?<br>\nWhy does it take so long to ship your service?<br>\nWhy do your maintenance coincide between each date and last so long?<br>\nWhy do your customers constantly complain?</p>\n\n<p>This thread is to remind those people who want to buy a cheap VPS or at a very low price, the dangers it can lead to, it is obvious that you will lose money on pests, as well as the waiting time.<br>\nI also remind the community to be aware of legal dealings and check if it is a legal and registered company!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-06/1665087058-198098-sin-titulo.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-06/1665086808-216915-sin-titulo.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n","editedAt":"2022-10-06T20:11:04+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6859"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6859"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2053"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"6859","attributes":{"username":"Daldude1","displayName":"Daldude1","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/wO0wuoOXl5TMUU0M.png","slug":"Daldude1","joinTime":"2022-09-17T21:07:11+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":3,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-04-08T02:55:31+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2053","attributes":{"title":"ApestCloud - Scams abound here","slug":"2053-apestcloud-scams-abound-here","isApproved":true}}]}

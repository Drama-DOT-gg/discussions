thought <br>\nWe are just taking action because while we made out term of condition and privacy policy we did a lot of research and hard work to make our legal documents so our user can easily understand it and they just copied it without any effort imagin it like this you are in a class with many students and teacher gave everyone same homework and you put your best and made a very nice project and then your class mate just copied it and good as good marks as you , will you be mad or not because you have put you time and energy on your project and you class made didn't put any</p>\n\n<p>And let me correct you once more you said that they have copied our documents and did some changes like change the name of the host to there <br>\nBut its the same thing as that your classmate copied your project and wrote his name in the front <br>\nName change is just a obvious change what do you think they will put our names host in the document sorry i ment to say there copied document  lameo <br>\nThat what i wanted to say <br>\nThank you</p>\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5025"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1269"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"37116","attributes":{"number":15,"createdAt":"2021-12-08T05:07:50+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a

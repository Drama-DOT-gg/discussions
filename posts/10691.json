He makes pump and dump servers where he bots people, gets a ton of user traffic, then the server underperforms and in a month or so he destroys what he created, bans all of his staff, then runs off with the donation money.  Also what people call \"scams\" are his no refund policy being intervened by false bans.  Yes, there are rules put on his website but it is very hard for the player to find them, therefore it is technically a scam.  He uses fake 50% off sales tags, and the \"SALE ENDS IN 24 HOURS\" tag will reset every 24 hours on Mortal Mines and Jurassic Mines, as shown in my first video.  Anyone who tries to speak out against him will receive threats, harassment, and many, many fake lawsuits where he tries to get something from you such as personal contact information.</p>\n\n<p>He goes by the name Lizardz, Economy, Eco, Level, Password, and now Energy.</p>\n\n<p>We recently caught him harassing a 13 year old admin that asked why he was banned <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiP2W/comments/mlqgo3/hero_mines_owner_harassing_a_13_year_old_admin/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiP2W/comments/mlqgo3/hero_mines_owner_harassing_a_13_year_old_admin/</a></p>","editedAt":"2022-10-11T07:45:15+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3365"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"365"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3365","attributes":{"username":"TheRealZonko","displayName":"TheRealZonko","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/It34WlXuDSBJfaWJ.png","slug":"TheRealZonko","joinTime":"2021-04-11T14:03:44+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":1,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-04-11T14:11:52+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2","attributes":{"username":"Sloth","displayName":"Sloth","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/6BdW7QU4UtMZIKtd.png","slug":"Sloth"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"365","attributes":{"title":"[LizardZ] | Scam MC servers | DM bots","slug":"365-lizardz-scam-mc-servers-dm-bots","isApproved":true}}]}

They forced us to order a new Ryzen 7 Hetzner dedicated server while we were already in debt. Darynode can't aford anything and it is unprofessional at that.

Before blaming anyone first think. So let me clear all ur dout.dchu said me he doesn't need any money then I said I will pay u something then Dchu and me decide that that will be the cost of node  we both will pay fine!!!. And I informed dchu that I have vast customer get ready for that he said he is ready. Ok according to them I need to pay 70 dolllar. Right and their vps is from hetzner  and that node cost 45 europe and let it be 50 euro after all charge. Link- <a href=\"https://www.hetzner.com/sb?cpu_from=9000&amp;cpu_to=40000\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.hetzner.com/sb?cpu_from=9000&amp;cpu_to=40000</a> . So why I need to pay them 70 euro . Then that node was not for me they are also using that node then why I will pay 70 dollar Even it's 50 euro. And and they didn't purchase any vps for anything separately for us. Me host suspend my all service and my id with out any information Or warning etc <br>\n. They suddenly ask me to give 70 dollar Or they will ddos my ip ( ddos ip is said by lonetty staff)  . Or create trouble for me etc. Then after argument they said I have 2 day if I will pay then I will get my server back if I didn't then I  lose everything . Fine!!! And I used their services for a list 5 days even not complete 5 days. So u say why I will pay 70 dollar and service not good even. BTW thank u Dchu. Dchu is cool person he tried is best to help but his staff. ... I am not blaming any one. And again thank u Dchu for ur 5 days help and making false thread on me. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-05/1633414083-482573-screenshot-2021-10-05-11-30-13-899-comandroidchrome.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-05/1633414083-603145-screenshot-2021-10-05-11-25-05-540-comdiscord.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4580"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1031"}}}}]}

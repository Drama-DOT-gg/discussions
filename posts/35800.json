If they have a Trustpilot, look at it, and if they have a very low number of reviews ensure those reviews are almost, if not all, positive.</li>\n<li>Interact with their support, sales support is quite literally just a tool for businesses to show themselves in their best light, so take advantage of this and have their sales team give you suggestions and help with choosing a package or a service. If they don't have a sales team, that's your cue to leave. If their sales team seems inexperienced or incompetent, that is also your cue to leave.</li>\n<li>Use common sense; if it's free to use don't expect the same data redundancy that Equinix would give you, oftentimes free \"hosts\" aren't scummy at all instead unrealistic expectations are set of what they provide.<br>\nIf their website/logo/branding/terms/discord/anything looks off, or generic, or copy-pasted, or anything negative, then <strong>leave</strong>.</li> </ol>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2784"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1218"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"35828"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2784","attributes":{"username":"europa","displayName":"europa","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/oXHOl1l6tlB1Ou4v.png","slug":"europa","joinTime":"2020-09-05T19:59:29+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":56,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-07-25T13:44:07+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"full stack dipshit","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4831","attributes":{"username":"Tato","displayName":"Tato","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/QklJARHhq7oQeC8k.png","slug":"Tato"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1218","attributes":{"title":"Cyperia's illegal activities.","slug":"1218-cyperias-illegal-activities","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"35828","attributes":{"number":52,"createdAt":"2021-11-19T04:05:55+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1218/50\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"35800\">europa</a> wrong thread</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4831"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1218"}}}}]}

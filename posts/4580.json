From the outside Falt looked like a good company, but I learned about the backside of Falt and learned what happened. (This is all from an admin telling me this, I'll also show a few dm messages). The truth is Vee was never a good person, Vee is underage in there county. They started a lot of fights and like in the post they used Falt for there own gain. A lot of stuff has happened but I am not going to explain further. Ever since the team left Falt and rebranded to Geschafft, they have been doing a whole much better. As they are not having the drag by Vee the can continue to work and I have been with Geschafft since day 1. What Vee recently did is a stupid thing trying to get his fame back. I would not trust Vee after what he did. (There are also more incidence that have happened before this major one.) Here are some screenshots from an admins dm (I blurred his name for privacy).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-20/1611174682-365063-proof-2.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-20/1611174682-518220-proof-3.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-20/1611174682-547044-proof-4.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-20/1611174682-746402-proof-1.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3015"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"155"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3015"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3015","attributes":{"username":"AviatorLachlan","displayName":"AviatorLachlan","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/BeBVo3R1dgQ17gKy.png","slug":"AviatorLachlan","joinTime":"2021-01-20T07:37:58+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":1,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-02-02T02:55:06+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"155","attributes":{"title":"!Vee Illegal activity sabatoging hosts to make his own grow ","slug":"155-vee-illegal-activity-sabatoging-hosts-to-make-his-own-grow","isApproved":true}}]}

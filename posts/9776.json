You shouldnt have plans you cant afford to fulfill.<br>\nSince it's a very small company I don't need a lot of ram and storage.<br>\nLiterally look at the answer above<br>\nWhy would I waste money on an expensive vps when I can get a cheap one for the 5 people that host with me.<br>\nWhy would you make plans you dont have enough resources for?</p></div></blockquote>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3290"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"328"}}}}]}

In this drama.gg we are talking about SharkHost, NOT StarNode, stay on topic, and secondly, I did not delete any node in this time, and the times that the servers were deleted were done by me and it was about 3 months ago, I did it because I had to delete the panel database because it was corrupted by the mysqldump that I did from the previous panel machine, and if I have to delete the panel database I have to delete the servers so I did a general deletion of servers, and also those deleted servers is only delete the folder /var/lib/pterodactyl lmao, you can see yourself that the IPs are always the same. And third, not because a random says that, means it's true, besides that capture is not the StarNode discord. bruh</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5569"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2013"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"5569","attributes":{"username":"vainki","displayName":"vainki","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/3yul3zlBJONvP1ws.png","slug":"vainki","joinTime":"2022-02-14T22:55:15+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":11,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-12-11T04:27:49+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2013","attributes":{"title":"SharkHost/ReleFree - The worst hosting in the world.","slug":"2013-sharkhostrelefree-the-worst-hosting-in-the-world","isApproved":true}}]}

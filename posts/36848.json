I have many questions about this thread. Plexed in fact, has absolutely nothing to do with mcworld. I am the owner of MCWorld and Plexed is not.</p>\n\n<p>I am aware of the unprofessional staff team we have at MCWorld and I will be working to get rid of a lot of them and bringing on many new ones.</p>\n\n<p>I have never encouraged or asked our staff members to review the hosting. In fact, I had encouraged them to not write a review about it. Nothing I can do about it if they do.</p> \n\n<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing invite rewards. It's a way of getting members and it works. It isn't against tos (that I know of) and it's just a easy way for our clients to get resources for their servers. It benefits us and our clients.</p>\n\n<p>Our \"shitass staff\" did not back him up. I typed \".-.\" because he has pinged twice. I was just trying to help a friend by posting his host in mine because mcworld has been down for some time because of some personal reasons with myself.</p>\n\n<p>Plexed may be carding.. I have no idea. I provide all the nodes for MCWorld and I pay for them all. (I can send proof when I'm on my computer).</p> \n\n<p>If you have any further questions please contact me on discord! <br>\nDubs#7708</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4996"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1265"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"36911","attributes":{"number":13,"createdAt":"2021-12-05T09:24:24+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1265/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"36848\">FlyingMane</a> well why just have one piece of text shown there tell The Alex to send full screenshot why just see the one word I said why not see the whole entire situation</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4857"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1265"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"36918","attributes":{"number":18,"createdAt":"2021-12-05T13:46:34+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1265/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"36848\">FlyingMane</a> Sryden has no longer controlled mcworld for over 3 weeks now</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4539"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1265"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"37008","attributes":{"number":24,"createdAt":"2021-12-06T20:21:45+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1265/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"36848\">FlyingMane</a> what the fuck does mcworld has to do with plexed or badsk? its fucking closed</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2871"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1265"}}}}]}

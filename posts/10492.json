Their Discord-server is called \"Nether-Hosting\":<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618035877-575573-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>They also have a rules channel, but it's called Fire-Node there ðŸ¤” They are also abusing Discord's rules-channel-thing, because there are no rules. They just applied the icon to draw attention to their arguments for being the best, their payment methods and links.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618035940-662372-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>When you open the domain that they give you (nether-hosting.nl), you find this:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618036036-249824-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nWhy is it called ZardHosting now??? Why would you want to operate under 3 names??</p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the Wappalyzer (a tool to find technologies behind a website) menu that I have opened, you can see that they are using WHMCS. Unfortunately, this is nulled.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618036226-58668-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>This got me interested in their cPanel license, and yes, also nulled:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618036251-218962-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The footer of their website says that they do not need to be registered, because they are Belgian.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618036588-662287-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nThere is a Chamber of Commerce in Belgium, it is called \"Kamer van Koophandel\" and you must be registered there.</p>\n\n<p>After all, I think this is yet another hosting owned by kids that want to make a quick buck and therefore don't pay for their licenses. They operate under 3 names which is very unprofessional and their footer states absolute non-sense.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added after around about 10 minutes:</strong> One of the COO's tried scamming me with fake credit card information for 'free Discord Nitro' earlier. I only just saw that he is the COO, which is why I am adding this now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added after 15 minutes:</strong> An alt account with the Fire-Node logo just came online and has the management role. Alts are not allowed.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-10/1618037633-62104-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n","editedAt":"2021-04-10T06:54:02+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3214"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3214"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"361"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3214","attributes":{"username":"RenderMelon","displayName":"RenderMelon","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/fPIeBhDX0CSKNEGZ.png","slug":"RenderMelon","joinTime":"2021-03-16T07:55:28+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":7,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-11-14T09:42:50+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"361","attributes":{"title":"Nether-Hosting | ZardHosting | FireNode","slug":"361-nether-hosting-zardhosting-firenode","isApproved":true}}]}

Man decided to switch to Bloxy.pro for whatever reason and is now developing a panel for them lol\" (Full quote). <br>\nSo let's start with the beginning. Ben has been a good RbxDomains admin, he made them a free panel (completely free), managed tickets and he was so good that everyone appreciate him. But one day he randomly decided to switch to BloxyPro (RbxDomains competitor) for absolutely no reason. Everyone felt so bad when he left RbxDomains, even the owner, Doeke. 5 days later Doeke sent the message (scroll up to find it) and Ben was mad just because of that. And, after a long discussion in the general chat, Ben leaked all of our IPs and email addresses in the RbxDomains discord server. I didn't see it, because it was deleted really fast. And because Goober still wanted to post our data to the public, he put the data on a public paste on Pastebin. But fortunately, Pastebin took actions on that paste so it was permanently deleted. Finally, Ben has been threatening us for days with DDoS attacks, and a lot of people were extremely scared. I had a dynamic IP so I was lucky. If you guys want to find out the full story I invite you to join the RbxDomains server and search up in the general channel and the announcements channel.</p>\n\n<p>RbxDomains Discord Link: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/8hdpSB7JHF\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.gg/8hdpSB7JHF</a> (Join that if you want to read the whole story, including announcements and )<br>\nBloxyPro Discord Link: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/BexKzdJRkC\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.gg/BexKzdJRkC</a><br>\nBen's Discord Username: TheyCallMeBen#6663</p>\n\n<p>Have a nice day everyone!<br>\nDon't forget to send image proofs in the comments section.</p>","editedAt":"2022-08-27T15:17:57+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4827"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4827"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2023"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"48642"},{"type":"posts","id":"48833"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4827","attributes":{"username":"SVR","displayName":"SVR","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/eHF65NOeqSTQ0ilX.png","slug":"SVR","joinTime":"2021-11-09T17:33:56+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":46,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-09-06T13:17:03+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"6785","attributes":{"username":"Mit","displayName":"Mit","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/aL68ryQ1uaMxpHEO.png","slug":"Mit"}},{"type":"users","id":"6683","attributes":{"username":"Goober","displayName":"Goober","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/kcHTRPus47aimuka.png","slug":"Goober"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2023","attributes":{"title":"TheyCallMeBen#6663 (Goober) | Leaking data, Toixc, DDoS Threatening and more","slug":"2023-theycallmeben6663-goober-leaking-data-toixc-ddos-threatening-and-more","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"48642","attributes":{"number":5,"createdAt":"2022-08-27T17:05:22+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2023/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"48637\">SVR</a> An update on the situation, a retarded staff of bloxy.pro (only fired bcs people began getting fed up of his bullshit - Bad pr and reputation for bloxy.pro) supports everything goober did.

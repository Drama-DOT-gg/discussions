As when Via shut down, a new host appeared it was ExoHost, and still again running services for users with no GPDR. He bans every user that complains about not tos, pp and gpdr so people wouldn't notice as much.

They are being nice to the guild to gain some trust. While at the guild, our team gathered some screenshots and evidence of him trying to scam, lie and destroy/raid hosts so users can come to their host until it releases. <strong>Just so you know they still fricking beg for VPS wtf</strong></p>\n \n <p>I am COO Management at HeikNodes</p>\n \n<p>Now on to the proof:<br>\nCredit to Tomas:<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-11-05/1604606522-956856-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nCredit to BobKabab:<br>\nHm?

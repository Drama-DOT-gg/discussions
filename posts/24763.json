I'm not talking services themselves but the CEO - \"Kasper\" is shady as fuck and I will provide some more proof to this claim as I proceed through this thread.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly until a few days ago they used to claim on their website that they were a non profit organization and were basically committing tax fraud by accepting donations and payments for SiteFold, hostwithgorilla, I understand that these donations and payments may be required to run the basic infra but why promote yourself as a non profit then? You can still find the google search results of them claiming that they were a non profit as you can see in the below screenshots</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387021-531509-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629386981-859433-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I'm going to attach a few screenshots of conversation from the Blesta and r/webhosting Discord server as that basically explains most of the things that I meant to bring to all of Drama.gg visitor's attention and leave it up to your judgement. Oh and you can also see the extremely unprofessional behavior of the CEO in the professional conversations.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387273-915950-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387295-268980-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387313-113069-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387331-199277-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387343-340837-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629387365-529265-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>ah yes, your friend has spoken to his lawyer and confirmed its allowed.

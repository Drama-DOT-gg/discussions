Also if you pay 30 cents per account why dont you provide a invoice proof and moreover why did you hesitate in telling me the license provider or even the IP of the server? and any explanations for deleting all your messages from my pms? why did you have to do that if you paid 30 cents an account. It does not make any sense my man.</p> \n\n<p>For a situation lets agree that you purchase accounts at 0.30$ but <strong>you sell it at 0.01515$ an account</strong> which is <strong>20 times less than the actual account cost</strong>.

(realistically, $60 per month when calculated, but I am being generous). it is not realistic nor possible that you can offer these solutions, and hey retard, theres something called editing cpanel licensing files, so if you pick up that 5 gram head of yours and admit \"i fucked up\" and dont null cpanel again, maybe i and others will have respect for you, you dirty fucking scammy retarded scumbag.<br>\nI have reported your website to the government of my country and your country, have reported it to all known hosting providers you used, and filed some piracy reports.

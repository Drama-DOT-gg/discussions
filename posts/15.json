He liked my server (BedWars) and i asked him if he want a tournament server. He said now, and after a few day he said yes. I helped him with some “Cards” (Claim your server, use code “XXXXX” for 15% free) and i made him an UI for his landpage. before that. So i started working, and the problems appeared. 10 Errors in 1 hour, i could not connect to the ftp, he fixed it and then they started again. I told him that if he will not fix the errors i will not be working anymore. He didn’t even respond. After this, we was calling in a group and joking. He left, i added him back, he left and unfriended me, and i told him what you will see in the photo below.<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-15/1594831078-452341-1593074143-792005-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>– i have the full rights to give it to someone else as the server mine.

The first condition was to put my advertisement on the channel where no one could type.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-15/1594831195-824092-1593077866-280862-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>However, the advertisement channel was available to type by anybody which resulted in their staff member (<a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Jedrik\" class=\"UserMention\">@Jedrik</a>) to make random advertisements to hide my advertisement.</p>\n\n<p>The 2nd condition was randomly made without my vote after the payment about “Owner of FabitHost (Jay/Snowman) will remove the advertisement message after 7 days” however he never mentioned that once I wanted to make the payment, which means I did not get my full service.</p>\n\n<p>Then I’ve tried to contact the owner of FabitHost however no success, the owner refused to provide me with the full service with my promised conditions.</p>\n\n<p>ALSO:</p>\n\n<p>The owner of FabitHost is using the stolen/leaked version of other business’s system code and he is also trying to tell about it is not other business’s code.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-15/1594831212-655176-1593078617-839400-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Due to this fact, the hosting is also using the stolen system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>---- End of repost from Summerhoax ----</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>NEW DATA!!!</strong><br>\nFabitHost have 1 node of 30 GB memory which is from Contabo, and in the machine - probably runs a lot of servers (let's say <sub>500</sub> servers OUT OF 1.6K MEMBERS WHICH ARE IN THEIR DISCORD GROUP!!!)</p>\n\n<p>It's craziness!

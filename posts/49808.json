Sole proprietorship is perfectly legal as you stated.

If anyone wants more information on these accusations you may message me directly on Discord and I will answer any questions to the best of my ability. However I do request you keep it mature, I'm not looking to argue or fight with random people ðŸ˜„</p> \n\n <p>Discord: Pengu#3221</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7096"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"49809"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"7096","attributes":{"username":"Pengu","displayName":"Pengu","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/1eQRNFMALLaeH1YR.png","slug":"Pengu","joinTime":"2023-02-19T19:01:06+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":34,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-08-25T09:15:01+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"sqcJzkLHGyrR8o4G.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Owner of Galactiq","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4739","attributes":{"username":"TheYeetster","displayName":"TheYeetster","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Bzg1ypsYeixFBMGH.png","slug":"TheYeetster"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2115","attributes":{"title":"Galactiq - A facade of Fraud and Theft","slug":"2115-galactiq-a-facade-of-fraud-and-theft","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"49809","attributes":{"number":7,"createdAt":"2023-02-19T19:25:45+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Yeah sure you are even a Sole prop.<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-19/1676834688-355679-eight.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nI don't think stripe can determine what you are when you have no legal documents regarding being one.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2115/6\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"49808\">Pengu</a></p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4739"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}}}}]}

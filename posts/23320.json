In my case, I mined Monero using MXRig, but I did stop after a little while.</p>\n\n<p>\"Promoting\" suicide.<br>\nEvery time \"kys\" or something similar was said, it was a joke, and obviously we didn't mean it. We are sorry to the people who have been affected by this and didn't take it as a joke.</p>\n\n<p>Racism. <br>\nYes, we do admit that there was racism on our server, we're sorry that the rules were never enforced.</p>\n\n<p>\"Pedophile\" staff.<br>\nPeople have made claims that some of our staff are pedophiles. They're not wrong.<br>\nA thread has already been made about Floppa, so we will talk about Thanik. They were a Staff Manager who posted images/videos of underage girls and boys, which was promtly deleted by me. We are sorry for this.</p> \n\n<p>Server raids.<br>\nWe have been accused of raiding DBH although this was never done by us. Hunolog, a friend of ours decided to raid DBH's discord server completely on his own, with no endorsement from us.</p>\n\n\n<p>Fraud/Carding<br>\nThe nodes used for panel.floppa.lol (down now) are from AWS Free Trial, using a method provided by Floppa. Due to them being carded, there was a big risk of data loss. Aswell as this, the domain 'oceaned.host' was carded from a 'known' registrar called strato using an old method.</p>","editedAt":"2021-08-05T10:26:28+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4135"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4135"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"859"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4135","attributes":{"username":"funeral","displayName":"funeral","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/E2ABhTpf71S4rdZn.png","slug":"funeral","joinTime":"2021-08-05T10:10:43+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":4,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-08-05T10:53:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"859","attributes":{"title":"Explaining about Floppa.lol/Oceaned.host","slug":"859-explaining-about-floppaloloceanedhost","isApproved":true}}]}

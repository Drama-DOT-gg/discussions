We got a drama.gg thread on october, we closed in july, so the host was still alive, ofc we were getting people that sent the link saying \"omg scammers\" but we honestly wouldn't care about them cuz what was in the thread was fixed since a while ago. Now lemme tell you that if you can't seperate positive and negative messages, you can't do an host, you need to understand that.<br>\nNow, if you somehow make a good host I will be happy to see that you did well, but right now all you are doing is exposing your stupidity on the internet, which is just a new proof of the original thread. <br>\nSaying \"yeah ur more dumb\" like an 11 kid game \"no u\".</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I need to stop answering to this idiot, all he wants is attention.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2850"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"906"}}}}]}

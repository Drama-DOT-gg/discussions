Only a few nodes have been enabled after DBH v2's release.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1353/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"39263\">CODER</a> lets talk about community, they are toxic as hell and a bunch of kids sending memes.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree that part of the community is toxic, but what is wrong with sending memes? Every single server on Discord have a channel for memes.</p> \n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1353/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"39263\">CODER</a> Imagine using commands in general chats as lounge</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Anything wrong with doing that? It's our problem if we do not mute for using music commands in general, Dan is ok with that so I can’t find any issue with doing this.</p> \n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1353/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"39263\">CODER</a> lets take a look at their website quality</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>The website is currently being remade, and the host mainly relies on the Discord server at the time I am writing this, so that is not a main issue.</p> \n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1353/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"39263\">CODER</a> By many people’s words, they say that Dan threatened to sue a hosting company and Dan did illegal activities such as DDoS attacks against them.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>You did not provide any proof for that.</p> \n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1353/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"39263\">CODER</a> lets take a look at other people’s reviews on this company</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>So since today sending a screenshot of a company's Trustpilot reviews is exposing them? Cool.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1353"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"39275"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"discussions","id":"1353","attributes":{"title":"DanBot Hosting","slug":"1353-danbot-hosting","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"39275","attributes":{"number":11,"createdAt":"2022-01-01T21:31:47+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1353/10\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"39274\">Dotto</a> It is a node and it is <strong>offline</strong> and I dont care if it is released or not. About the memes, there is a channel about that but your shitty moderation don’t punish people for posting stuff wich should be in another channel and it is childish. About Dan ddosing and threating to sue it is a fact. As I mentioned DanBot Hosting did a Cease and Desist against Listed.Host for copyright infringement. And posting reviews of other people opinion about the host and posting facts isnt good? Think twice.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5191"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1353"}}}},{"type":"users","id":"5191","attributes":{"username":"Dark","displayName":"Dark","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/o17GBsSfNNuSqdJa.png","slug":"Dark"}}]}

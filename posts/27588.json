SLA is stands for Service Level Agreement, it clearly says it's an agreement in the short form. I wouldn't mind if you call me a law expert but you sounds like a dumb saying it since it's pretty common sense and falsely claiming it on multiple websites.\" - Jerome.</p>\n\n<p>\"both of you still being exposed by me\" That just shows your maturity levels in a nutshell. You are exposing nobody. Meerely calling them out and 90% of them you haven't looked jack shit into.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-11/1631361185-947289-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nThis guy closed his host, and then you still feel the need to make a post about it. It didn't even take me a minute to find this message saying they were closed. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-11/1631361259-133610-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>\"I am sure you have been busy lately since you couldn't wait for other host for their ToS and create a post for it. It's funny how you handle DDoS attack for calling the DDoS guy out instead of protecting your server from DDoS.\" - Jerome</p>\n\n<p>Well, if you took the time to look through (Which we established you don't do), the attack stopped weeks ago now and all customers were credited. We also have makde sure this won't happen again by adding extra protection protocols. Also I called the guy out for DDoSing, <strong>because it is illegal</strong>. And you say I couldn't even wait for another company to finish their TOS? Mate, they were operating without one. That üëè is üëè illegal üëè.</p>\n\n<p>\"Would you like to share more about that? Like what's the outcome lol.\" - Jerome</p>\n\n<p>What are you on about, people can go to the post I made and clearly see what you did. You just got butt hurt that I called you out for it and then go and try to attack every company you can find my guy. It is sad. Extremely. Go touch some grass.</p>\n\n<p>Message big man jerome sent: <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-11/1631361686-875811-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"909"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"27594"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_","joinTime":"2020-12-13T20:34:09+00:00","discussionCount":8,"commentCount":425,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-25T17:08:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3859","attributes":{"username":"Jerome","displayName":"Jerome","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/umHCxS4MxN79EUzf.png","slug":"Jerome"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"909","attributes":{"title":"abdullah.#0001 | DDoSer | Threatening to DOX | Lots of downtime on company","slug":"909-abdullah0001-ddoser-threatening-to-dox-lots-of-downtime-on-company","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"27594","attributes":{"number":169,"createdAt":"2021-09-11T12:45:46+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/166\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27588\">Jamie_</a> This guy closed his host, and then you still feel the need to make a post about it.

I suggest you gotta increase the price more so you could credit your customer more refund for more downtime. Calling out the guy for DDoS, are you kid or something? He DDoS your company and the best action you did is exposing him, nice solution! Keep saying his action are illegal won't work, I heard it thousand times but you can't even send a lawyer letter to him and fine/put him in jail. Stop acting professional if you aren't. Kids running company, haizz.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/166\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27588\">Jamie_</a> What are you on about, people can go to the post I made and clearly see what you did.

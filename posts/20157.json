It's owned by <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/438-willy-pro-7-12-year-old-kid-raiding-servers-illegal-operation-and-more/154\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Willypro7</a>. If you don't know who he is, he is the owner of <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/411-moonhost-ran-by-kids-copied-privacy-policy-and-more/185\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">MoonHost</a>, a professional scammer and skid. Some of his skills include overallocating his nodes, scamming people, skidding code, and using nulled software.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, getting back to the topic of this thread. Red Moon Host literally banned me before I even joined the server, and banned my friend as soon as he joined.</p>\n\n<p>Heres some proof,<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851454933223735367/860517904691757062/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The host is also run by kids who don't know what they are doing. This can be seen in the Willypro7 thread and the MoonHost thread linked above.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this, and feel free to add onto this. I am sure there is a lot to add on to this thread, but I just couldn't investigate anything as I was literally banned before joining.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3351"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"755"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3351","attributes":{"username":"MysteriousK69","displayName":"MysteriousK69","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/ABOR5lBU0cUCwlDP.png","slug":"MysteriousK69","joinTime":"2021-04-08T05:55:35+00:00","discussionCount":10,"commentCount":283,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-08-01T08:13:45+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Giving the best hosting at Lawliet.Host","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"755","attributes":{"title":"Red Moon Services | Banning without a reason | The return of Willypro7","slug":"755-red-moon-services-banning-without-a-reason-the-return-of-willypro7","isApproved":true}}]}

They still illegally using WHMCS, the site is still live, it's still against WHMCS EULA.

We also have makde sure this won't happen again by adding extra protection protocols. Also I called the guy out for DDoSing, because it is illegal.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>A host who tried to promise 99% SLA without DDoS Protection and causing many downtime, how funny is that? I suggest you gotta increase the price more so you could credit your customer more refund for more downtime. Calling out the guy for DDoS, are you kid or something? He DDoS your company and the best action you did is exposing him, nice solution! Keep saying his action are illegal won't work, I heard it thousand times but you can't even send a lawyer letter to him and fine/put him in jail. Stop acting professional if you aren't. Kids running company, haizz.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/166\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27588\">Jamie_</a> What are you on about, people can go to the post I made and clearly see what you did. You just got butt hurt that I called you out for it and then go and try to attack every company you can find my guy. It is sad. Extremely. Go touch some grass.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>I am sure you did the same, couldn't laugh more.</p> \n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/166\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27588\">Jamie_</a> And you say I couldn't even wait for another company to finish their TOS?

Grabbing peoples IPs, sending your customers to a rickroll video, making a post about every host you set your eyes on and having a broken brain isn't an easy fix.

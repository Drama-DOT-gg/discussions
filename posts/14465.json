Over the years, it has been amended several times, most recently in 2008, to cover a broad range of conduct far beyond its original intent. The CFAA prohibits intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization, but fails to define what “without authorization” means. With harsh penalty schemes and malleable provisions, it has become a tool ripe for abuse and use against nearly every aspect of computer activity.</strong></p>\n\n<p>where?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/it-legislation/28174/what-is-the-computer-misuse-act\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Computer Misuse Act (UK)</a></p>\n\n<p>where? where? and where?</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3379"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"485"}}}}]}

And truthfully, running a speed test with a \"very fast\" internet speed wouldn't crash the browser, no matter how. The browser crashed probably because the machine probably low on RAM? Or too less processing power. Idk. Saying the browser crashed because the internet speed is too fast is too idiotic. Even if God forgives them, but I won't. ðŸ¤£</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3453"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"412"}}}}]}

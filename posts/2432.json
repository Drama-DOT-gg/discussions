It's like these people expect Freenom to let them keep their free domains forever. They have to make money somehow, and if another site offers them money for a domain they are giving to someone else for free, why wouldn't that take that offer? It's clearly outlined in their TOS, and even further, after you register a free domain you can search it again on Freenom and see that they are clearly taking offers for it.</p>\n\n<p>If you were paying them for the domain, it would be a different story, but there's always a catch when it comes to free services. No one should expect less. They own and operate the TLDs independently so they are free to do business the way they want.</p>\n\n<p>Just get a paid TLD for crying out loud, those are super cheap nowadays.</p>","editedAt":"2020-09-28T21:08:08+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2833"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2833"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"100"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2833","attributes":{"username":"ressonix","displayName":"ressonix","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/nooPALEPZL4X1Qqq.png","slug":"ressonix","joinTime":"2020-09-25T20:16:18+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":4,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-08-25T16:25:55+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"100","attributes":{"title":"Freenom - Fraud","slug":"100-freenom-fraud","isApproved":true}}]}

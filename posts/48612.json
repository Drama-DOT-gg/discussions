It was because <strong>the panel's database was corrupted</strong> and we had to restart everything to fix some errors because of this. So, almost 2 months later, it's impossible to a free node to stay up THAT much time. And there wasn't any nodes change in this period. Still the same ips, even numerical ones.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to the CSS code: <strong>VyxterHost and StarNode are linked</strong> and the owners have work together, so there's no copy.</p> \n\n<p>Now this:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2018/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"48590\">Pelotudo_</a> this hosting was rated by Ajneb himself, and he gave it a score of 0.3/10 due to its lag, bugs, errors and much more.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Ajneb tested the host in a date that the host was still, not even on beta, but a pre-beta phase. Obviously the host was full of errors and bugs, so there's the point. But now, a lot of time later, the host has changed. A lot of problems had been fixed and the stability is a lot better.</p>\n\n<p>So how about <strong>you</strong> test the host yourselves (When the dashboard is up, and before you say something, <strong>MAINTENANCE, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG ABOUT THE DASHBOARD ON MAINTENANCE.</strong>) and tell me how your perspective changed.</p> \n\n<p>â€” JustNotSebas#7887</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6781"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2018"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"48615","attributes":{"number":16,"createdAt":"2022-08-26T22:57:40+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2018/13\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"48612\">Pelotudo_</a> Currently it has already exceeded 30 days and still the same nodos..... apparently the fuck they have given to sharkhost has hurt too much XD</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6777"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2018"}}}}]}

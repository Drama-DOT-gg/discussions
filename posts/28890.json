I did 90% of those partnerships. You managed sales due to dchu taking breaks and such. Everyone has a life, and at this point you don't. How many threads have you been involved in with US? You have caused us trouble, we want some justice too you know. You can't just have your fun doing whatever you want. We want to be succesful. You can't do everything at one company, Tesla may have started with 2 people but then worked day on day.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4026"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1016"}}}},{"type":"users","id":"4026","attributes":{"username":"IoNetty","displayName":"IoNetty","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/bxpKLp1Y6DahxxDT.png","slug":"IoNetty"}}]}

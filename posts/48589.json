It is more always put as an excuse that it is not fair that free users have more resources than paying users and so take advantage of each month to change your account to another free. I also noticed that they use 6 machines that are the exact ones that the free trial gives you.

In this drama.gg we are talking about SharkHost, NOT StarNode, stay on topic, and secondly, I did not delete any node in this time, and the times that the servers were deleted were done by me and it was about 3 months ago, I did it because I had to delete the panel database because it was corrupted by the mysqldump that I did from the previous panel machine, and if I have to delete the panel database I have to delete the servers so I did a general deletion of servers, and also those deleted servers is only delete the folder /var/lib/pterodactyl lmao, you can see yourself that the IPs are always the same. And third, not because a random says that, means it's true, besides that capture is not the StarNode discord. bruh</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5569"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2013"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"48734","attributes":{"number":14,"createdAt":"2022-08-31T01:01:56+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2013/12\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"48594\">AngelGuerrero</a> First of all, what horrible English, secondly, when starting StarNode i showed the invoices, moreover with the same logic that SharkHost also show the invoices, which is no good even if they do, because the invoices are editable, this is all a matter of morals and logic. And the Oracle free trial only gives ONE Ampere machine which is ARM architecture and only has 24gb ram and 4 cores. And by the way...

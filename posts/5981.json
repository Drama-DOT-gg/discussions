Also accusing someone of being 13? Really, I mean Discords ToS does also allow a 13 Year Old so I am not sure what you are getting at there.\n\nIf you have any more issues please feel free to reply to this as I will reply back!\n\nSincerely,\n**`Rizer - Ice Host CEO`**</code><script async=\"\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" data-hljs-style=\"github\" integrity=\"sha384-oTqfbnKDrROJYNQZI1U//Vr36HEjwJafOewSUYYyb5OXhv0r2qRQcjAP3yXa4HCg\" onload=\"hljsLoader.highlightBlocks(this.parentNode)\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/s9e/hljs-loader@1.0.24/loader.min.js\"></script></pre>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"191"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"5984"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"discussions","id":"191","attributes":{"title":"\"Ice Hosting\" Sketchy (BabyAces) (IceHosting is fine)","slug":"191-ice-hosting-sketchy-babyaces-icehosting-is-fine","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"5984","attributes":{"number":7,"createdAt":"2021-02-07T01:26:26+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/191/6\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"5981\">Rizer</a> all replies invalid, once a winterhoax always a winterhoax.

I saw her typing something so I'm going to assume that she has typed a message so that the second I accept her friend request she can send it.. I'm not as dumb as her to go and accept her friend request,</p>\n\n<p>I wish there was a way to warn people to not join her discord because I've heard She has people join her discord just to get their IP Addresses which really wouldn't surprise me in the slightest..</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3077"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"147"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"5673"},{"type":"posts","id":"5674"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3077","attributes":{"username":"gothicflufflepuff","displayName":"gothicflufflepuff","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"gothicflufflepuff","joinTime":"2021-02-01T22:55:19+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":15,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-02-10T04:40:46+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3036","attributes":{"username":"Vanquish","displayName":"Vanquish","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/fggUflkAbpVpGb63.png","slug":"Vanquish"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"147","attributes":{"title":"Century Hosting | Watzon","slug":"147-century-hosting-watzon","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"5673","attributes":{"number":100,"createdAt":"2021-02-02T01:48:47+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/126/82\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"5672\">gothicflufflepuff</a> <br>\nshe's such a scum bag lmfao</p>\n\n<p>she runs this booter/stresser by the way:<br>\n<a href=\"https://pmastresser.xyz\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://pmastresser.xyz</a></p>\n\n<p>You won't win with her, she's very ignorant.

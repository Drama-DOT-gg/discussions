' If they pass you the ip of the machine or domain go to '<a href=\"https://check-host.net/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://check-host.net/</a>' go to info and scan the website and see if the website is hosted in google or other company, if it say cloudflare this method will not work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WEB HOSTING</strong><br>\nI will remind you of something so that you do not get confused by the hosting that say they offer 'unlimited space' it is not that it is a scam, just keep in mind that it is impossible to provide unlimited space and ram since logically it is not possible, I recommend you ask what is the ram limit that your web page can use, also keep in mind that a page hosted on a hosting is not a super heavy business page, since if it would a company website it will be hosted on a vps and not in a web hosting of '5 usd', Also whenever you buy, ask if the server is shared or dedicated, shared servers usually cost less than 5 usd for a lot of space, whereas dedicated ones cost more than 15 usd (In some hostings)</p>\n\n<p><strong>DO NOT MOVE FROM THE PLATFORM</strong><br>\nIf they are selling you a hosting for discord speak for discord, if they tell you to go to telegram or related apps tell them no, since discord will not be responsible if he is a scammer, I also recommend you always record the conversation to be able to Report on these types of forums to prevent others from being scammed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PAYMENT</strong><br>\nRemember that if the owner of the hosting asks you to pay him for 'Payment of friends and family' and he scams you, paypal will not be responsible if he scams you, and the guarantee og customer protection policy will not be activated, this is the same with bitcoins and cryptos,  remember that cryptocurrencies do not have a backup bank for them so you will not have anyone to ask for your money back. Always pay by PayPal 'Payment of services'</p>\n\n<p><strong>DATA LEAK</strong><br>\nYou have to take into account that you have to be careful where you buy your website or vps, since the owner of the services will be able to see what you do inside and sometimes they abuse and can steal information from your users, Always buy in hostings that are verified, or that you see that they are trustworthy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Take care of yourself ðŸ™‚</strong> <br>\nI hope it helps you</p> \n\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3645"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"515"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"2775"},{"type":"users","id":"3518"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3645","attributes":{"username":"N1K","displayName":"N1K","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/nqFBGMv5NPxoR5zz.png","slug":"N1K","joinTime":"2021-05-18T04:40:32+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":2,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-05-18T17:59:28+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"Un5YJx8PJx3pFpv6.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2775","attributes":{"username":"onyx","displayName":"onyx","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/4FIfyyg630q4VoZp.png","slug":"onyx"}},{"type":"users","id":"3518","attributes":{"username":"Dubs","displayName":"Dubs","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/cnGuHezum5BxvBYI.png","slug":"Dubs"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"515","attributes":{"title":"Avoid being SCAMMED -  Before buying a HOSTING check this thread","slug":"515-avoid-being-scammed-before-buying-a-hosting-check-this-thread","isApproved":true}}]}

Deadbush, you talked only with amber actually but not without other people, so you cant say that the owner is rude, everyone has is problems, and lots of time she was joking, we are a really nice staff, im trying every day to make the 3/4 people that chat in a good conversation. About chirag, he's right, it WAS a pay to win server. Now, we are redoing ranks, so people can stay better in the server. If you have any question to do, you can enter the server or dm. (Just don't grief the MC server like Chirag lol) im trying to do the most nicely job as mod, like everyone of the servers should be. Hope i didn't waste your time. Have a nice day!</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3363"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"359"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"10477"},{"type":"posts","id":"10479"},{"type":"posts","id":"10484"},{"type":"posts","id":"10552"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3363","attributes":{"username":"Axel229","displayName":"Axel229","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/F4xfuqctD3lH44B0.png","slug":"Axel229","joinTime":"2021-04-09T19:38:13+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":41,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-05-09T15:48:15+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2801","attributes":{"username":"DeadBush","displayName":"DeadBush","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/XbjcjyJPwRXjAX5J.png","slug":"DeadBush"}},{"type":"users","id":"3027","attributes":{"username":"AlphaDarky","displayName":"AlphaDarky","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"AlphaDarky"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"359","attributes":{"title":"Scuffed MC server and Owner.

Everyone says it was a joke after performing sins. You thinking creating those rules are joke where people don't have freedom of speech? And the owner literally says it's my server I have rights to ban you. And the owner literally even banned people for no freaking reason. And you call all that a joke? Your server owner literally dms people to beg to buy ranks. You guys had creative mode Access, anticheat bypass in Legend rank.

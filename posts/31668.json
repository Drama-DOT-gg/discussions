They have all been told they are on thin ice and I have been suffering with covid for the last week so have not seen what they have been doing. Besides, your the one pointing fingers at me!

I saw it all the time.</p>\n\n<p>Sort out your attitude mate, you didn't used to be like this. Read through an entire post first before attacking them like that.

Then they got a VPS for their MC servers and it always got overallocated by blackcat. This was also around the time my host was starting up and you will see why this is important. So I bought a node and a little later Rihard(that owns the VPS btw) offered to use it for my host and I said sure. Now arc profits where low and HUGE SERVERS where popping up where I had to balance the earning system and reset everyone's coins. So Rihard sees this and got mad so he says fuck you I am making my own host but he did let us get the data off first. So back story out of the way. now the juicy stuff! So he claimed what I did was unfair and thought he could do better. Also because I wanted to poke them I told them to remove some code I made when they where a MC server. They did remove the code. After their dumbasses start asking for devs and not just asking OUTRIGHT BEGGING. Ofc i was one person they begged. they also begged my co-ower Matt. Now that doesn't sound too bad but they are basically copying everything about my host and don't rlly know shit about running a host yet somehow go and buy VPSs. So they asked me to do there crap so I took the chance and pulled the biggest troll of all time. Now the owner being dumb couldn't setup DNS so I went to freenom and picked up and domain and proceeded to install ptero using that. Still the owner thinks I set it up and his domain. Legit dumest owners out there. i will post pics as replies. Also if your too lazy to install ptero and have IQ i can do that lol.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2906"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"215"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"6888"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2906","attributes":{"username":"EmeraldMike","displayName":"EmeraldMike","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/1rg2pycqBRDqnLR9.png","slug":"EmeraldMike","joinTime":"2020-10-23T02:30:14+00:00","discussionCount":6,"commentCount":335,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-07-12T23:05:21+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"xnrdU9MB4pngBpo3.jpg","cover_thumbnail":"thumbnails/xnrdU9MB4pngBpo3.jpg","canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Don't touch my hentai","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3133","attributes":{"username":"James","displayName":"James","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/qnH9bvJdRJ9635u2.png","slug":"James"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"215","attributes":{"title":"Skycastle Hosting","slug":"215-skycastle-hosting","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"6888","attributes":{"number":16,"createdAt":"2021-02-20T11:38:01+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/215/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"6868\">EmeraldMike</a> yh but pterodactyl claim those who don't have experience with the Linux os should turn back</p> \n\n<ul><li>just saying btw that puts others off idk if they tried or not *</li></ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-20/1613821045-13559-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3133"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"215"}}}}]}

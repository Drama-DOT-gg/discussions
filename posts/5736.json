That's why they took preventative measures and forced people to understand that reselling services such as VIP packages within a FiveM server is ALSO against terms of service.</p>\n\n<p>What are you going to do, give EVERY server on fivem negative rep that offers things for $?</p>\n\n<p>All offering fivem resell servers does is allow people to host the game for cheaper, allowing them to take advantage of not needing to pay ridiculous prices at Zap-Hosting. Want to upgrade your zap hosting server? NO problem! That will be a %50 increase of your bill, regardless of what options you have selected. Go after zap. Go after fivem. I don't understand what your problem with hosting sites offering fivem reselling is, but your backbone isn't very strong.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3081"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"180"}}}}]}

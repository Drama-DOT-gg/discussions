We do not falsely report amount of tickets and it is indeed real tickets, proof - <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/8zLlzLu\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://imgur.com/a/8zLlzLu</a></p>\n\n<p>Regarding the ignore at the direct message level, it is our staff member right either to ignore user or help them in the direct message since in correct way, you should contact us either through Discord public channel (if it is not sensitive case), Discord ticket system or email.</p>\n\n<p>About the employees, we do have legal employees and volunteers, our Discord server support team (do not confuse it with company employees) are volunteers whos goal is to help people for generic issues, regarding legal employees, we currently have 3 legal employees at company which receive salary for their hourly work.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, our mail server is up and running, I have made testing email and it works just fine, are you sure something have not went wrong in your side?

Guess what? The only 2 people I trusted enough to give the token to were Aypro and Willy. Aypro is still trusted by me and he has no reason to raid as we are in this business together and both are making profits. Plus, he is not dumb enough to only raid the server. If Aypro wanted to ruin the company, he has the access to panel, Discord, all the VPS's, the PayPal, and pretty much everything as an admin. So, that just leaves out Willy as the only suspect for the raid. So, I think we can conclude that Willy raided Lawliet.Host's server.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>when I left Lawliet.host almost sure that u rested token or something, and why would need to raid?</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3291"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"438"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"12841"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3291","attributes":{"username":"Willypro7","displayName":"Willypro7","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/6ejKNQiaajcKH8Zi.png","slug":"Willypro7","joinTime":"2021-03-29T16:39:19+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":172,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-07-24T13:34:58+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Lol","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3351","attributes":{"username":"MysteriousK69","displayName":"MysteriousK69","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/ABOR5lBU0cUCwlDP.png","slug":"MysteriousK69"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"438","attributes":{"title":"Willy Pro 7 | 12 year old kid | raiding servers | illegal operation | and, more","slug":"438-willy-pro-7-12-year-old-kid-raiding-servers-illegal-operation-and-more","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"12841","attributes":{"number":15,"createdAt":"2021-05-01T11:59:50+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/438/10\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"12835\">Willypro7</a> I did not reset the token.

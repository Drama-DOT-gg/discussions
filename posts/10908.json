The support was extremely perfect, but the performance was crap. I thought the reviews I saw on youtube and the reviews on trustpilot was ok and real. But they were not. I had 3 months of reseller hosting at you and in these 3 months, 1 month was meh, 2 months was not okay. I got dd0sers attacking my site, and the dd0s protection did not work. You said I have 250 Gbps dd0s protection, I don't understand. You did nothing to me wrong, just the performance and your hosting's performance was a bit crap.</p>\n\n<p>I know you work hard but, I don't really liked that BillingFox was not good optimized and It crashed + we needed to reinstall it like everytime, and then when I put the store after an update to billingfox the data is gone.

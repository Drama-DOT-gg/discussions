We got donor 2 when donor 1 was overloaded. I've also tried to improve the server. But we have a voting system for changed we want to make. They changed stuff without permission. We have a role called Kunder (it means Costumers). We didn't just target the Swedish role. But it says \"Pick your region\" and not \"Pick any role you want\". Our community manger was working and wasn't online very much. The \"#UsersRightsMatter\" is a very rude comparison against \"#BlackLifeMatters\", it's very disrespectful how you dare compare racism to a role.</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4320"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"890"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"26218"},{"type":"posts","id":"26232"},{"type":"posts","id":"26236"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4320","attributes":{"username":"Pajsen","displayName":"Pajsen","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/WZ27vHRxyK6TlLxq.png","slug":"Pajsen","joinTime":"2021-08-28T23:11:49+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":33,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-05-06T22:29:35+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4201","attributes":{"username":"Aaron_","displayName":"Aaron_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/jjT3NoTeKl684ba2.png","slug":"Aaron_"}},{"type":"users","id":"4197","attributes":{"username":"Cnnn666","displayName":"Cnnn666","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/PMgsY1ldkzME4yFO.png","slug":"Cnnn666"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"890","attributes":{"title":"Sweplox Hosting | Low Quality Service","slug":"890-sweplox-hosting-low-quality-service","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"26218","attributes":{"number":591,"createdAt":"2021-08-29T12:41:54+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/890/571\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"26179\">Pajsen</a> #UsersRightsMatter Was A VALID Thing That We Created Because Oscar And Albin Described How They Rule The Server And What's Fair Or Not Doesn't Matter To Them.

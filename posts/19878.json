Sham said that Rumguru used to brag about his nodes &amp; stuff in the server, and rumguru is making claims like he used to swear, but he has no proof to back it up! Sham has actually acted professional except for some times, and he is also underaged to be running a hosting company. OTAHosting has not acted professional. Except some people.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3871"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"578"}}}}]}

I wasn't even going to open source my ProxyBot. I shouldn't need to give myself credit for something I wasn't going to give other people. I only gave Bocon so he could run it for his hosting at the time. I open-sourced it to get credit since he seems to want to take all of it for making half the things he stole but since it is now open sourced I think I should get credit for him using it.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3669"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1919"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"47396"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3669","attributes":{"username":"DarkInk","displayName":"DarkInk","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/v4hznKudhT3G5T96.png","slug":"DarkInk","joinTime":"2021-05-20T13:42:16+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":15,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-06-26T05:14:28+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2839","attributes":{"username":"Toki0179","displayName":"Toki0179","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/iBzLMMlRk1nF3DNc.png","slug":"Toki0179"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1919","attributes":{"title":"Luxxy hosting ( free hosting ) - luxxy stealer","slug":"1919-luxxy-hosting-free-hosting-luxxy-stealer","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"47396","attributes":{"number":21,"createdAt":"2022-05-05T16:58:10+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1919/20\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"47395\">DarkInk</a> If it's stated in the license that he must be giving credit to the creator of the bot then he is in the wrong.

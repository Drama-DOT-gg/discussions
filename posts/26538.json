For example, many of our all-nighters were to no avail, as management would just revert the config the next morning and then ping us with literally \"WTF\". I got tired as it got to the point where I was fixing the same things, every day.</p>\n\n<p>After starting ExtraSRV, we wrote a proposal to Nixxon (don't want to share the DM here, as it would harm Nixxon too much). We agreed to merge, with only one of the admins disagreeing. The admins that agreed told us to proceed anyway with the merge, where we were allowed to change the name etc. Then, after spending a whole day setting up ExtraSRV, everything was reverted by the admin who had not agreed and we had lost all our work. This made us very mad, leading to the raid below.</p>\n\n<p>We originally planned the raid as a joke, because of all the trouble we went through with management, and we very well know that it was against TOS, but we were past the breaking point.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4340"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"941"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"26539"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4340","attributes":{"username":"Anony","displayName":"Anony","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/izdjg4R76hEdbIOF.png","slug":"Anony","joinTime":"2021-08-31T19:08:54+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":5,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-09-18T09:31:39+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3059","attributes":{"username":"calcal","displayName":"calcal","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/XxFociqFitu7Q1bY.png","slug":"calcal"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"941","attributes":{"title":"ExtraSRV - New hosting was made a day ago.","slug":"941-extrasrv-new-hosting-was-made-a-day-ago","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"26539","attributes":{"number":26,"createdAt":"2021-09-01T19:36:35+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/941/25\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"26538\">Anony</a> still against tos xoxo doesnt change shit</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3059"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"941"}}}}]}

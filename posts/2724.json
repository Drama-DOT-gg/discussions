Justin ( Known as TMC ) has scammed us all. He has made a redirect of <a href=\"https://holobilling.xyz/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://holobilling.xyz/</a> to now <a href=\"https://fuckholohosting.xyz/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://fuckholohosting.xyz/</a><br>\nHe removed WHMCS access to our admin panel, which means we cannot cancel paid subscriptions with our users. It also means that recurring every month or so people are paying for services that are no longer existing, which also falls short of another scam.<br>\nHe changed his name in discord from TMC to \"JustinTK#1234\" now, because he didn't want to be spammed with messages, and wanted to hide his identity. His business he registered is what he ruined himself, he scammed, he took money away from people and still is ( we are asking them to cancel the subscription from their accounts ).</p>\n\n<p>Anyone think TMC is a good guy now? I don't think so :)</p>\n\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2849"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"88"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"2729"},{"type":"posts","id":"2740"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2849","attributes":{"username":"vijaypondini","displayName":"vijaypondini","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/502nxgrYlal8kUtg.png","slug":"vijaypondini","joinTime":"2020-10-01T05:41:30+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":12,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-02-20T10:52:43+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"7","attributes":{"username":"Jedrik","displayName":"Jedrik","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/DQfRHtHKGcVT6AZv.png","slug":"Jedrik"}},{"type":"users","id":"50","attributes":{"username":"eraters","displayName":"eraters","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/InBbUrIiLh2f1NZE.png","slug":"eraters"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"88","attributes":{"title":"Holo Hosting LLC","slug":"88-holo-hosting-llc","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"2729","attributes":{"number":201,"createdAt":"2020-10-01T08:44:54+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/88/200\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"2724\">vijaypondini</a> I've always thought of tmc as scummy, doesn't change anything about Holo :) The victim card ain't working here :)</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"88"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"2740","attributes":{"number":203,"createdAt":"2020-10-01T12:37:27+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/88/200\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"2724\">vijaypondini</a> He only did it because holo is a scam</p>\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"50"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"88"}}}}]}

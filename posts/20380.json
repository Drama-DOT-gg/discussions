I just said about this theme that's the almost same concept/design but changed one thing. I don't really have any issues with this as long as it's getting fully recoded, and it's not bought from MCM and claimed that you made it or that you 100% modified it.</p> "},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"758"}}}}]}

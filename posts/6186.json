Later on <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Rizer\" class=\"UserMention\">@Rizer</a> was promoted back to Developer then even Staff Manager, Later on he and <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/197/6\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"6158\">Javacraft</a> started dating. When that happened he was constantly taking advantage of Aces and using him for fame and to get power in Ark Hosting, When aces denied him what he wanted aka Director role in Ark Hosting, He then proceeded to add me and <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/luffy\" class=\"UserMention\">@luffy</a> to a group chat where he threatened to attack Ark Hosting if we did not comply with what he wanted, Eventually the drama died down... Until today... <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Rizer\" class=\"UserMention\">@Rizer</a> got mad over Aces making someone panel admin on Ice Hosting's Panel. Even when I was staff at Ice Hosting, I had signed a contract stating I would be a member of \"Management\" but I was only given Developer, <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Rizer\" class=\"UserMention\">@Rizer</a> said Aces agreed to that but I asked aces and he gave me manager and Panel Administrator because that was how it was supposed to be. He also said he was going to use the Dashactyl Dashboard files from Ark Hosting for his own host. Those files are a custom theme for Dashactyl Dashboard that is copyrighted. If he does so he will be sued. So to be honest... <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Rizer\" class=\"UserMention\">@Rizer</a> is a LIAR and a Scammer. He has lied countless times to me and <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/197/6\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"6158\">Javacraft</a>. <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Rizer\" class=\"UserMention\">@Rizer</a> needs to learn his lesson and stop being a child.</p>\n\n<p>Proof: <br>\n<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763876760529535027/805657549000802394/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763876760529535027/805657549000802394/unknown.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763876760529535027/805657597461790740/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763876760529535027/805657597461790740/unknown.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763876760529535027/805657467412545597/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763876760529535027/805657467412545597/unknown.png</a></p>\n\n<p>Sincerely, <br>\nFallen - CTO of Ark Hosting</p>","editedAt":"2021-02-08T04:20:12+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3023"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3023"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"197"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3023"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3023","attributes":{"username":"Fallen","displayName":"Fallen","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/ryMBA4UrU0BP8Yo6.png","slug":"Fallen","joinTime":"2021-01-22T02:07:47+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":74,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-12-03T01:22:22+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"197","attributes":{"title":"Rizer | Ice-Host","slug":"197-rizer-ice-host","isApproved":true}}]}

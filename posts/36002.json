This thread does have a purpose, I literally asked you two questions that had no toxicity or disrespect implied and you bursted out with a rude attitude and whatnot. You told another member that was \"“defending\" you that you’re too busy to show him the rules because you’re playing roblox yet you claim to be a business or whatever. I have nothing against you personally but I highly recommend you get your act together and quit acting like a fool.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3755"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1230"}}}}]}

So today I came to an interesting hosting, 'ReleHost', they are Spanish, so some of you may not understand the messages, but I'll translate a bit.</p>\n\n<p>So first of all, they are using nulled WHMCS, (they are using a WHMCS theme, that's why I know it), and of course, this is what the license checker pops up: (Didn't knew it was a template, my bad.)<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-17/1621278632-78625-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Also, I love the \"Lorem Ipsum\" on their privacy policy and the title of the Privacy Policy website: <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-17/1621278674-773397-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-17/1621278688-761656-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Also, this is their \"ToS, which is in \"the works\" when they already started to sell services.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-17/1621278811-734712-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>This is the ticket so far: <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-17/1621278874-486454-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nTranslation:<br>\n(<br>\n    + = Me<br>\n    - = Their staff<br>\n)</p>\n\n<ul><li>Hi, I'd like to make a question, if you are using WHMCS, then why does it pop up as not licensed? And why are you selling services w/out having a valid ToS/Privacy Policy?</li>\n<li>We aren't using WHMCS, but we will do soon</li>\n<li>But the webpage seems similar right? VelocityNode website? And also, I love the website title @ privacy policy website.</li>\n<li>It's a template which is being sold at a webpage</li>\n<li>But, you should have a valid ToS/Privacy Policy first of all in order to sell services, right?</li>\n<li>\"We are working\" on it</li>\n<li>Illegal hosting? (No response since this, I'll update thread if they respond.)</li></ul>","editedAt":"2021-05-17T19:27:06+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3427"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3427"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"514"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3427","attributes":{"username":"babyharpseal","displayName":"babyharpseal","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/gIjyTXWXF9yBA4uq.png","slug":"babyharpseal","joinTime":"2021-04-21T14:45:49+00:00","discussionCount":6,"commentCount":77,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-03-11T11:22:59+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"514","attributes":{"title":"ReleHost, Interesting hosting, no ToS/Privacy Policy.

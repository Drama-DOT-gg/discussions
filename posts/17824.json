So, he left a 3 star review because our servers are laggy as we don't give a ton of CPU on the free plan (which was the case quite a while ago, but we give a ton more than that now), nothing wrong with that, and I respect his review.</p>\n\n<p>What I don't respect is him going into general, asking for the resources he got for inviting 20 people even after 7 of them left and never joined back. Everytime we asking him for the resources, he said \"X stars\", X always being lower than his previous review. If this doesn't make it isn't awfully obvious that he was trying to sell us reviews, I don't know what will.<br>\nChecking his invites:<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842607156661846047/849511558110249000/Screenshot_601.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nAypro offered the resources back if he gave proof of everyone joining back, but he tackled it with \"sMh 2 STarS nOW\".<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842607156661846047/849511563828527124/Screenshot_603.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842607156661846047/849511558827606026/Screenshot_602.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nDecreasing the review score even further after I denied to give resources<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842607156661846047/849511566297792512/Screenshot_605.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nBad support because we aren't giving you resources for literally nothing?

They know where you live they know what internet provider you use and if they try to scrape it they might even know your phone number. A ddos attacks takes up a lot of bandwith and they can overload your server with a loads of charge you need to pay (if you are on a pay on go) plan or your provider can get your internet suspended because of overtaking bandwith. If you try to ip log someone you know irl thats reasonable you can walk out your house and find him/her but if its over the internet i would say be careful you never know what he can do.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3322"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"962"}}}}]}

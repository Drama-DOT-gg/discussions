If I didn't have real job or more free time I will use it for the server. But I have to babysit Aron and scoopy and teel them to stop changing things on the server. Because they treated the server if it was there own. That why I'm so inactive sometimes. I work nearly everyday 6-16 and 12-20.</p> ","editedAt":"2021-08-18T21:14:08+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4199"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4199"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"890"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"24468"},{"type":"posts","id":"24470"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4199","attributes":{"username":"OscarFrid","displayName":"OscarFrid","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/b5HOIe0f3N2faYvW.png","slug":"OscarFrid","joinTime":"2021-08-18T10:11:15+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":115,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-09-16T21:12:12+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4201","attributes":{"username":"Aaron_","displayName":"Aaron_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/jjT3NoTeKl684ba2.png","slug":"Aaron_"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"890","attributes":{"title":"Sweplox Hosting | Low Quality Service","slug":"890-sweplox-hosting-low-quality-service","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"24468","attributes":{"number":385,"createdAt":"2021-08-18T21:15:43+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/890/384\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"24467\">OscarFrid</a> they changed some settings on the actual server.

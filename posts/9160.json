I didn't wanted to bring politics here but that's the best way to explain.<br>\nSome Support Communist<br>\nSome Support Democratic<br>\nDoesn't mean they are racist or discriminative towards each other. No right? cuz they know everyone has different opinion and different issues to work on. I won't say they don't have compition but they have compition in some way. One party may think they need to win election. Other may think they need to develop the country first before anyone wins. They have compition on two different things here. I know half of my words don't make sense but adjust cuz I'm from Asia and My first language isn't English. <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/mituishere\" class=\"UserMention\">@mituishere</a> :- OMG you are racist cuz u don't saying you don't know English more than your First language. So think twice and think about others opinion, issues faced by others before posting your one sided shit opinion.</p> \n\n<p>Plus u said Falix only wants money.<br>\nRemember that Lamaker aka Pamar needs to pay for nodes which isn't cheap. So customers from Countries with lower ad income are increasing which is Making it hard for falix to pay for the stuffs. And they didn't even completely ban them they just said earn few coins or invite a friend easy.</p> \n\n<p>Ok If you want falix to unban countries they will for sure but you need to pay for the loss ok?<br>\nif no then stfu</p>\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2801"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}},{"type":"users","id":"16","attributes":{"username":"Pamar","displayName":"Pamar","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/lr35CsrQrf1b4wyG.png","slug":"Pamar"}},{"type":"users","id":"3175","attributes":{"username":"ely","displayName":"ely","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/uQHlc6TKjTtLggmz.png","slug":"ely"}},{"type":"users","id":"2801","attributes":{"username":"DeadBush","displayName":"DeadBush","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/XbjcjyJPwRXjAX5J.png","slug":"DeadBush"}}]}

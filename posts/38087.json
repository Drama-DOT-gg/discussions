I can confirm personally no machine we use or have ever used has been a trial machine.</p> \n\n<p>I would gladly provide proof of Invoices from the start of Flow Nodes to current. I can also provide a full inventory of our devices and proof of payment for each individual device since purchase. If anyone would like me to post the evidence regarding anything I have previously stated I would gladly.</p>\n\n<p>Please, before making any accusations about a company or an individual, get your facts confirmed and actually find physical evidence of the issues you have with the people you are slandering.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nCain</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3416"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1299"}}}}]}

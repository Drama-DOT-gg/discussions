SLA is stands for Service Level Agreement, it clearly says it's an agreement in the short form. I wouldn't mind if you call me a law expert but you sounds like a dumb saying it since it's pretty common sense and falsely claiming it on multiple websites.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/968/27\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27444\">Jamie_</a> I wouldn't worry about this post.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, pretty much this post isn't for you but sounds like you interested on this post.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/968/27\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27444\">Jamie_</a> He has done like 10 in the bast couple days, I don't think he has much else to do.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>I am sure you have been busy lately since you couldn't wait for other host for their ToS and create a post for it. It's funny how you handle DDoS attack for calling the DDoS guy out instead of protecting your server from DDoS.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/968/27\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27444\">Jamie_</a> He also tried attacking my company after I called him out for cracking cPanel I think it was.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Would you like to share more about that?

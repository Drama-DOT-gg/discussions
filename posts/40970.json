You just linked the explanation of what a free trial is. Also the big providers don't care what you do with the servers, if you resell them or not. <br>\nALSO <br>\nGoogle out right fucking states you cannot card their nodes <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-18/1642506737-573627-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Now two things come out your post:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>You have never interacted with an owner of abused nodes</li>\n<li>You dont fucking know what carding is nor you want to learn about this</li></ol>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1404/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"40965\">Wischard</a> Technically reselling cloud service is not illegal, it's more like a value-added service</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>What? Reselling a cloud service is not illegal but highly immorala nd any host that resells free trials should be banned off hosting servers forever. There will be a dataloss every month or so, and your customers will end up losing their shit in a matter of minutes. if you defend free resellers go eat a dick</p> \n\n\n","editedAt":"2022-01-18T11:55:45+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4955"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4955"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1404"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"40973"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4955","attributes":{"username":"TheAlex","displayName":"TheAlex","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/QCemA07tJA7U6C54.png","slug":"TheAlex","joinTime":"2021-11-28T23:02:52+00:00","discussionCount":4,"commentCount":91,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-10-16T08:55:25+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"I own Argon Hosting kekw","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2951","attributes":{"username":"Chirag","displayName":"Chirag","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/EBu92nGgi2Y9tYOD.png","slug":"Chirag"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1404","attributes":{"title":"Using Free Trials is not illegal at all","slug":"1404-using-free-trials-is-not-illegal-at-all","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"40973","attributes":{"number":4,"createdAt":"2022-01-18T12:00:47+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1404/3\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"40970\">TheAlex</a> you both are wrong about most things here.

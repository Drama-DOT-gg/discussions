I am here to expose the owner of the server. (Note to moderators: if you see this being reported, it's the admin asking it's members to report the post, as he did before Also, credit to u/Inevitable-Cry7214, u/SortFit, \"Sir William Domfoe Chad ðŸŽ©\" (the owner of funcraft), and u/padfoot9446 for supplying me with proof.</p>\n\n\n<p>The owner and co-owner IP-grabs members of his server. Here is an example of one of his many victims-<a href=\"https://ibb.co/PwFjFH4\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/PwFjFH4</a> Alternative link: <a href=\"https://rsmp-exposed.am0g.us/raid-assy-man/PKFTNDt8\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://rsmp-exposed.am0g.us/raid-assy-man/PKFTNDt8</a></p>\n\n<p>The owner has doxxed (leaked the information) of one of his moderators (ask u/SortFit for more information, he is the one who got doxxed)</p>\n\n<p>When I was still a member, I saved the server from a hacker. The co owner then tried to take all the credit (in reality, he did nothing at all) The co owner also has threatened one of my friends with DDOSing. - <a href=\"https://ibb.co/rstz3DJ\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://ibb.co/rstz3DJ</a></p>\n\n<p>The players are very toxic.

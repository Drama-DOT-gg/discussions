Finally, regarding what he criticized vainki without knowing him, you just know that I know vainki enough to know what an immature, lying and manipulative person is.  Thank you very much for your review, here is my answer.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6765"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2018"}}}}]}

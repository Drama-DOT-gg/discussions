The hole point here is that he does nothing like he says that he took down over 9 websites but all of them are still up except overavax, he has not proof of a takedown if you ask him, he also is trying to copyright a paid template that he got for free <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-01-05/1672943744-214261-image.png\" title=\"\"> and did not pay. The funny thing is that he is underage to register a domain as he claimed that he is 13 years old i don't think you can register a domain at that age, He was also doing some bad stuff on internet like nuking a game panel at an old host called CloudMC. He used to have a whmcs installation to billing.scriptname.net<br>\nEverything started when I installed a whmcs test version on my domain to test something, and after that day he started his noabuse thing. I warn guys, this guy has some dark history, do not trust him. Everything he does is trying to get some attention, he is just a kid that does not have something better to do. <i> Also this is a small update imagine calling yourself Lewis Goom if you see this get a life also here is some more proof of this idiot <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/4XBjQzg.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://i.imgur.com/4XBjQzg.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/BO000eA.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://i.imgur.com/BO000eA.png</a><br>\n</i></p>","editedAt":"2023-05-05T22:11:11+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6974"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6974"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2094"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"7046"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"6974","attributes":{"username":"MythicalDoggo","displayName":"MythicalDoggo","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/XYQSuLkMCfV4gXZU.png","slug":"MythicalDoggo","joinTime":"2022-11-09T16:32:16+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":8,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-05-05T22:11:11+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"7046","attributes":{"username":"SuperHori69","displayName":"SuperHori69","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/obKWCF9NQ9GLPsP2.png","slug":"SuperHori69"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2094","attributes":{"title":"Lewis G. aka [ItzScripts, alvapepsi]","slug":"2094-lewis-g-aka-itzscripts-alvapepsi","isApproved":true}}]}

I do try to make sure the software is actually locked down for security and privacy reasons.<br>\nI'm going to get in touch with the owner and make sure the app used correctly, if they're using my code then I'll just keep tabs on it.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, I believe an Electron app can be harmful and can be used as a token logger. As you can include extra executable files using Electron Builder and have a button or an 'onload' function execute this file. Again, I keep it locked down as much as I can.</p> ","editedAt":"2022-02-16T07:07:06+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3377"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3377"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1600"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"44154"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3377","attributes":{"username":"Korbs","displayName":"Korbs","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/CUD5vV2bKVwuF8sd.png","slug":"Korbs","joinTime":"2021-04-12T21:09:34+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":29,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-04-23T00:59:26+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"pJuk2IYynPvIGi76.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Pretty nice developer, who doesn't scam people like an idiot would :)","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"5523","attributes":{"username":"Milan1000","displayName":"Milan1000","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/l8ahnNEcaUxfhvHB.png","slug":"Milan1000"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1600","attributes":{"title":"HalexNode's Desktop","slug":"1600-halexnodes-desktop","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"44154","attributes":{"number":22,"createdAt":"2022-02-16T07:24:32+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1600/21\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"44153\">Korbs</a> Korbs idk if halex will still be a thing, It got stolen by shershah like a couple of days ago and got renamed to EnderNodes, And im pretty sure the app isnt in progress anymore too.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5523"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1600"}}}}]}

So I said yes, because I was being nice and I saw a lot of growth in the community of G-Host. So I came on and I was doing a-lot updates, and the staff was okay with  it till I renamed it JavaCraft.best. They didn't believe I asked alpha but here's proof I did.

That is my whole side of the story, If you need more proof, i'll show more proof.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3711"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"713"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"19441"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3711","attributes":{"username":"Skie","displayName":"Skie","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/OuGNIutPnmNj4JBk.png","slug":"Skie","joinTime":"2021-05-25T12:35:08+00:00","discussionCount":3,"commentCount":82,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-07-03T20:48:54+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3832","attributes":{"username":"ThinusDL","displayName":"ThinusDL","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/afrj873Wa268nmbH.png","slug":"ThinusDL"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"713","attributes":{"title":"G-host Hosting named as JavaCraft.best","slug":"713-g-host-hosting-named-as-javacraftbest","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"19441","attributes":{"number":139,"createdAt":"2021-06-21T03:54:23+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/713/128\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"19348\">Skie</a> You didn't even follow his one condition and what about the server logs of G-host where you added the nuker thing.

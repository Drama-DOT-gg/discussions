I have spoken with our provider and he agrees it is a DDoS attack. You can also believe all you want that they are photoshopped images, he knows the screenshots are real and so do I. He is just butt hurt that I exposed his ass and so did trustpilot reviews. Also if you have \"tried\" my service and it is \"teribble\", why haven't you told us? You can't just say something is terrible, cry about it and then never tell someone so it can be fixed. Also if you look in the screenshots at the end of the post it shows Netstat and Nethogs logs to prove it is under attack.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/2\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25316\">CaveMan98765</a></p> ","editedAt":"2021-08-22T16:29:18+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"909"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"27203"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_","joinTime":"2020-12-13T20:34:09+00:00","discussionCount":8,"commentCount":425,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-25T17:08:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3860","attributes":{"username":"SteveCos","displayName":"SteveCos","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/2fVyENL44s13O97d.png","slug":"SteveCos"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"909","attributes":{"title":"abdullah.#0001 | DDoSer | Threatening to DOX | Lots of downtime on company","slug":"909-abdullah0001-ddoser-threatening-to-dox-lots-of-downtime-on-company","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"27203","attributes":{"number":161,"createdAt":"2021-09-07T08:41:54+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/3\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25317\">Jamie_</a> Nice to hear that since you're complaining SomeHost don't have great uptime.

Which is then against FiveM's Privacy Policy.</p>\n\n<p>If you however BUY a single VPS, and install FiveM on that, that alone is different, and is considered a FiveM server. What you're saying is 2 things in 1 message. You can't just Resell them, and make profit. Then its considered stealing.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1282/9\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"37347\">Sky</a> Even attempting to resell any FiveM hosts is against their Service Agreement.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>What I said was a fact, quoting from FiveM's Privacy Policy.

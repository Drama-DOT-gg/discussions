On second thoughts, you yourself are a bit rude with an \"owner\", and you just gotta admit it. That too, I solely think that the demotion of staff just because they had communist tag was unnecessary, you could infact right click the staff and \"CHANGE NICKNAME\" and DM the guy instead of removing the role? Didn't you know that it exists? O_O</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4442"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1718"}}}}]}

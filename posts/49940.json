Almost like they were added intentionally and also for some reason, all the security features in his electron app were disabled even though they are enabled by default.</p>\n\n<p>Both of the vulnerabilities are really simple to fix.<br>\nI'll list them below</p>\n<ul><li>using innerHTML to set content pulled from his api, and node Integration is enabled in electron which seems to be done intentionally</li>\n<li>Downloading peer2profit on their pc when they run his afk app (p2pclient.exe on windows) without consent of the user. It also could lead to RCE, since file hashes are NOT checked on download and it is downloaded and ran automatically.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Proof of intentionally disabling electron security features: <img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/9e5e5468-a7b6-41ea-bd93-f0f7d6b3465e.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/92ccdb2e-b4c8-47d7-94dc-89de73d89693.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>There's no mention of the app installing peer2profit: <img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/92b346ce-2651-40a0-9b5c-fb5330f6a94e.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nYet the app still installs it which is extremely sus.<br>\n<img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/aa02ca39-7a37-402c-bdbd-c6d3c556f679.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nThe app also has a tracker built-in, <img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/f8dd6deb-43cd-43a8-ad6f-b7a22f75c10a.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>In case J0SH deletes the app off his client panel, here's an archive url for it: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20230222145233/https://cdn.optikservers.com/apps/afk/OptikServers_AFK_Setup_0.2.0.exe\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">http://web.archive.org/web/20230222145233/https://cdn.optikservers.com/apps/afk/OptikServers_AFK_Setup_0.2.0.exe</a></p>\n\n<h2>NOT HASHING PASSWORDS</h2>\n<p>J0SH also stores passwords on optikservers' client panel, these passwords are not hashed but are encrypted instead which is absolutely stupid.<br>\n<img src=\"https://usercontent.catto.pictures/chirag/a355cf9a-e353-48bc-8634-8080f1470bf2.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>At this point, I'm convinced that optikservers was made to be insecure.<br>\nAnd remember, I found those vulns for free, didn't ask for a single penny, and also reported them instead of abusing them, still this retard is absolutely ungrateful and still argues about <strong>WHY</strong> should he patch the RCE vulns and why should he hash passwords.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there was another XSS vuln I found in his client panel itself, which he fixed, this might be the only bug he has ever fixed ngl.</p>\n\n<h1>HostAris</h1>\n<p>Currently, HostAris is fairly new, so there's not much.

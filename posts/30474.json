This Breaks ToS(Don't whine about it saying \"Oh It breaks ToS but Discord doesn't care\" Cool, DBH still Bans for it and has before.) So Someone (Not Naming Names) Showed him Using Powercord in Staff chat to ask to Ban him. Well He got Banned so he went and cried to Dan's Dm's, So Dan in Staff news Spam Pinged Warning staff that He(Chirag) was allowed to use it and Nobody else. So Staff chat went crazy. I will just leave the images below for you to see</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>pretty sure discord doesn't care if people uses powercord or no, they can't really prevent that from happening</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4014"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1071"}}}}]}

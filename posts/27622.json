They still illegally using WHMCS, the site is still live, it's still against WHMCS EULA.

Just they weren't designed for a massive scale Layer 7 attack like it was. It was confirmed by our providers that it was a massive attack and they even focused their protection to our IPs to stop it.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/169\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27594\">Jerome</a> A host who tried to promise 99% SLA</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>That issue was sorted a long time ago and was an easy fix. Grabbing peoples IPs, sending your customers to a rickroll video, making a post about every host you set your eyes on and having a broken brain isn't an easy fix. I am supprised at this point someone hasn't made a post on you for how much of a nuisance you are.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/169\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27594\">Jerome</a> I am sure you did the same, couldn't laugh more.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Did I?

I sure hope not for your sake.</p>\n\n<p>Oh yeah, BTW from reading all your responses, thought you could do with this: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/English-Ages-Collins-Easy-Learning/dp/0007559844/ref=asc_df_0007559844/?tag=googshopuk-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=310850997089&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=6718730258351745715&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1007040&amp;hvtargid=pla-333222169435&amp;psc=1&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/English-Ages-Collins-Easy-Learning/dp/0007559844/ref=asc_df_0007559844/?tag=googshopuk-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=310850997089&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=6718730258351745715&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1007040&amp;hvtargid=pla-333222169435&amp;psc=1&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1</a></p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"909"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"27890"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_","joinTime":"2020-12-13T20:34:09+00:00","discussionCount":8,"commentCount":425,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-25T17:08:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3859","attributes":{"username":"Jerome","displayName":"Jerome","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/umHCxS4MxN79EUzf.png","slug":"Jerome"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"909","attributes":{"title":"abdullah.#0001 | DDoSer | Threatening to DOX | Lots of downtime on company","slug":"909-abdullah0001-ddoser-threatening-to-dox-lots-of-downtime-on-company","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"27890","attributes":{"number":174,"createdAt":"2021-09-12T12:33:53+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/170\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27622\">Jamie_</a> That issue was sorted a long time ago and was an easy fix.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Yea, and in my case solved in hours and just because for your misunderstood and stupidness.</p> \n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/170\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"27622\">Jamie_</a> Grabbing peoples IPs, sending your customers to a rickroll video</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Getting visitors IP is in our Privacy Policy, which you meant to agree on when you enter our sites.

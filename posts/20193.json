They literally changed some colors and layouts and called it fully modified. What do you mean fully modified if the sidebar, the main point of the cheese theme is still there, with just some news icons and a non-color instead of yellow?</p>\n\n<p>Today, they've told me that they fully reworked the panel.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-02/1625259244-1142-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nIt's still the same theme, but they've changed one part from it and they call it 100% new. Modifying one thing is not going to make it 100% new.</p>\n\n<p>Now they're saying that the old theme doesn't exist anymore, so they can protect themselves and they say that it doesn't matter because they changed the code from it. I'm sorry but I'm not the one who is flexing with a stolen idea.</p>\n\n<p>The main problem isn't that they've used the theme or edited it, the problem is that they called it 100% edited and that nothing was left in there from it. If it was 100% edited, as this is how you presented it, why was the sidebar still in there without any other modifications than the color and the icons? Also, please stop flexing with your landing page. It's so generic that everyone can say that they've seen something similar like it before.</p>\n\n\n<p>Let's get over the theme part.</p>\n\n\n<p>Someone in the server () said if we can give him DMS with invites of hosts which sell VPSes and dedicated servers, so I've told him about System413, because they are cheap, and at that time, I wanted to get a VPS from them. Here's Vanquish trying to compete with sys413, but he doesn't own any IRL server/node. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-02/1625260569-835789-captura-de-ecran-din-2021-07-03-la-001509.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-02/1625260686-245777-captura-de-ecran-din-2021-07-03-la-001744.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nI'm sorry, you're trying to compete with sys413 but you still didn't finish ur landing page...?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-02/1625260114-48623-captura-de-ecran-din-2021-07-03-la-000827.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>So let me understand if you sell Minecraft servers on a node from OVH or Hetzner it gonna make your host better? Then get ready to throw off your dedicated servers and rent some from Hetzner/OVH!</p>\n\n\n<p>I'm curious about their VPS prices, I mean, they're trying to compete with sys413 but the biggest VPS they can offer it's an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 with 6 vCores and 32 GB ram...</p>\n\n<p>The problem is not with the other staff members from there, only with Mackabu and Vanquish, as they're the 2 guys which say that what they do it's <strong>totally new</strong> and that <em>they're better than sys413</em> (which comes out from Vanquish comportment in the conversation about system413)</p>","editedAt":"2021-07-02T21:41:51+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"758"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"20221"},{"type":"posts","id":"20371"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"discussions","id":"758","attributes":{"title":"Gamespeed (Mackabu and Vanquish)","slug":"758-gamespeed-mackabu-and-vanquish","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"20221","attributes":{"number":8,"createdAt":"2021-07-03T04:03:13+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/758/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20193\">mituishere</a> I can confirm that they did not copy cheese theme</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3102"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"758"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"20371","attributes":{"number":26,"createdAt":"2021-07-04T15:58:39+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/758/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20193\">mituishere</a> totally new and that they're better than sys413 (which comes out from Vanquish comportment in the conversation about system413)</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>can you show when we said we're better than sys413 or any other company?</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3755"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"758"}}}},{"type":"users","id":"3102","attributes":{"username":"luffyy","displayName":"luffyy","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/xFEfTkY0K2RUw3jn.png","slug":"luffyy"}},{"type":"users","id":"3755","attributes":{"username":"Lucas","displayName":"Lucas","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/TObCEWZ37jPO8TM4.png","slug":"Lucas"}}]}

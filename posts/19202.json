Sure you can have a Discord support server for community help but using it for internal communications and product delivery? I don't quite get that.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly I used to do a lot of that stuff but people trying to make it look stupid to not do it on Discord is why I quit running a hosting company and moved on to develop a PROPER SaaS product.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some useful tools in case you want to start an IaaS, SaaS, or hosting company and you're planning on being serious.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Basecamp: It's not a bad collaboration tool to start with.</li>\n<li>Google Workspace or Microsoft 365: This is a pretty standard solution, but for a reason. They've stood the test of time and are much more reliable than many other solutions.</li>\n<li>Hubspot: Pretty much perfect for your helpdesk.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Another thing I see too much is Pterodactyl + WHMCS. Pterodactyl is made mostly for game servers, and it's still not the best for it. Minecraft server hosting and Discord hosting is really niché, yet still crowded. This is a weird combination and to be honest you should just start a general hosting company IF you're serious. Make your own management panel too, if you don't have the resources to do so you don't have the resources to start a proper host.</p>\n\n<p>Here's another important note: Once you start making around 50$+ a month, register your business and incorporate. In fact, you should technically do this before starting, it's just that the government gives you some leeway most of the time so you can experiment.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing: gain experience. Learn how to work with cloud services and manage server fleets properly. This can take you a few years, but you can do it if you actually persist.</p>\n\n<p>Here's another option:<br>\nDon't start a standard hosting company. Instead, come up with a unique product/service and sell it. If it's good, users will gradually come in.</p>\n\n<p>To clarify, I'm not saying I don't believe in people starting hosting companies at a young age or just at any point without experience. I just want to make it clear that this \"discord bot host\" is probably NOT your future, and you should be patient and learn.</p>\n\n<p>Discouraging 10-year-old \"hosting company owners\" isn't going to work, because we all know kids can be ignorant. Instead, I like to take an approach in which I point these people in a better direction for if they really want to run a software/infrastructure business.</p>\n\n<p>But anyways, stop running \"hosts\" on Discord. Take the time to learn how to do it properly, and it'll work better in the long run.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2996"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"716"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3755"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"587"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"601"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"604"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"714"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"785"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2996","attributes":{"username":"cedric","displayName":"cedric","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Q6zN0KZED0z6EO3m.png","slug":"cedric","joinTime":"2021-01-18T10:31:23+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":6,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-05-26T13:50:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3755","attributes":{"username":"Lucas","displayName":"Lucas","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/TObCEWZ37jPO8TM4.png","slug":"Lucas"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"716","attributes":{"title":"Stop.

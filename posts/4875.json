We're working on purchasing a new WHMCS license but we're a little short for money at the moment. Navo Hosting decided to delete our license. We are a new hosting provider, we've just recently established our website that is the explanation for a missing TOS/Privacy Policy. Firewalk is not a data farm. We will sort the issues you listed as soon as possible. Thank you for organizing them.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3021"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"163"}}}}]}

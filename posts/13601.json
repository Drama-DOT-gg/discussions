For now we can start small with the hosting. We have never scammed anyone or stole money either. Even if Puggo doesn't know much about being a system admin, we have many staff that do. I agree that we learn a lot more about the industry and get older, but we want to start early and see how things go. Thanks for the advice, if this host dies or doesn't work out, we will consider your opinion on waiting until we know more about the hosting industry.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3530"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"173"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3530","attributes":{"username":"Verse","displayName":"Verse","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/vjbz2AeKzq7bvwC5.png","slug":"Verse","joinTime":"2021-05-06T20:08:15+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":58,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-10-19T01:55:06+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"173","attributes":{"title":"Puggo","slug":"173-puggo","isApproved":true}}]}

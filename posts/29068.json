This shit is getting funny, Well anyway. Most of this will only make sense if you have been in mehost for a while, so let me get into it. About the bad finances part.. We may be in bad financial condition  but we are slowly making that money back bit by bit. We may be in debt after all, but were still running. We try to provide a great experience for our customers and everyone who uses us, and that goes with it. We aren't gonna shutdown unexpectedly due to a unpaid bill. We would alert everyone before it happens, we aren't that type of people here at mehost. Also, why is it spelled \"withror\" in the title? Accusing without proof? Dchu clearly sent screenshots, go read the thread back. Don't say something that isn't true to be honest. Let's get into unprofessional. All of our staff have been trained a bit and we take pride in them. If you have any issues feel free to contact me or dchu and we can get it resolved. We take pride in that type of stuff, there is competition after all. G-Host and that crap isn't involved in this. It's mehost and zach. You were always demoted for a reason, the first time was for mass pinging staff. You were almost demoted another time due to mass pinging members about a weird youtube video of all things.. What are you trying to prove with that. At this point your just trying to ruin our SEO by putting this to the top of google search results. I'll say it again. G-Host has nothing to do with this. It's just MEHost and zach. Also one thing about finances, it was no better when you were there. We try our best and we make a great service. You can't change that so easily.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4026"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1018"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"29091"},{"type":"posts","id":"29092"},{"type":"posts","id":"29094"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4026","attributes":{"username":"IoNetty","displayName":"IoNetty","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/bxpKLp1Y6DahxxDT.png","slug":"IoNetty","joinTime":"2021-07-21T13:07:55+00:00","discussionCount":4,"commentCount":247,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-04-02T02:26:55+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1018","attributes":{"title":"MeHost | unproffesional | bad finances | accusing withour proof","slug":"1018-mehost-unproffesional-bad-finances-accusing-withour-proof","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"29091","attributes":{"number":10,"createdAt":"2021-09-20T08:38:30+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1018/4\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"29068\">IoNetty</a> neil you wouldnt understand you joined after v2 you dont know the whole story</p>"},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1018"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"29092","attributes":{"number":11,"createdAt":"2021-09-20T08:39:25+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1018/4\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"29068\">IoNetty</a> and never did i say you guys have bad service infact its very good but the point which makes it unproffesional is how bad at financing and how bad at managing the management of mehost is</p>"},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1018"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"29094","attributes":{"number":13,"createdAt":"2021-09-20T08:41:56+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1018/4\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"29068\">IoNetty</a> \"trained\" pfffttt</p>"},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1018"}}}}]}

I am one of the directors for Gamespeed / GameSRV.</p>\n\n<p>I can not either confirm or deny the \"accusation\" of modifying a theme.

I can beleive it is custom coded, but I can not be sure about that.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know with sys413, they DO use Hetzner, but they colo with them. They have their own hardware just colo it in a Hetzner datacenter.  At least they did that last time I checked. I might be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>GSRV has been \"under maintnance\" for quite a while.  We picked the domain \"gamesrv.io\" because \"gamespeed.com, net, org\" etc was taken and there where no sites on them.  GameSRV seemed to be the best option at the time.</p>\n\n\n<p>I will take distance for the topic related to \"sys413 is better than ovh and hetzner\" and all that stuff.  I do not agree on that part.<br>\nI can just speak from my experience. I never used sys413, so I do not know how their things are working or the performance of their hardware.  I use OVH and Hetzner.  OVH is better than Hetzner in my opinion.  I can not and will not speak about sys413 since I never used them.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2994"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"758"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"20205"},{"type":"posts","id":"20226"},{"type":"posts","id":"20339"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2994","attributes":{"username":"TMKC","displayName":"TMKC","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/UhcfducRdtHAy91f.png","slug":"TMKC","joinTime":"2021-01-17T16:40:04+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":37,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-02-04T12:57:12+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3456","attributes":{"username":"samxd","displayName":"samxd","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/DN9JmlfzPUkAj29W.png","slug":"samxd"}},{"type":"users","id":"50","attributes":{"username":"eraters","displayName":"eraters","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/InBbUrIiLh2f1NZE.png","slug":"eraters"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"758","attributes":{"title":"Gamespeed (Mackabu and Vanquish)","slug":"758-gamespeed-mackabu-and-vanquish","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"20205","attributes":{"number":3,"createdAt":"2021-07-02T22:41:37+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/758/2\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20203\">TMKC</a> I do understand your concern on the fact that GSRV has been under maintenance for some time, which is around two weeks. However, this does not mean it is \"dead\" as your co worker has claimed. GSRV will be back in operation with a registered trademark once we have purchased and colocated owned hardware.

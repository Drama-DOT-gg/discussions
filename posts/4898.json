Thank you for the information, everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Please take these factors into consideration before purchasing a WHMCS license from a reseller:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>If you have to replace the license.php file, they are using a specific method to authorize your installation which has not been approved by WHMCS. They are not authorized resellers.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Are the licenses sold individually? This indicates that they are not an authorized reseller.

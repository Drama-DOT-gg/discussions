We fixed this and publicly apologized about said things. As for the rest of our site is all fixed. As for the viewing of customer servers without their permission and showing them to others this is simply just false. I would love to see Pic / Video / audio proof of us doing this. It is not only a violation of the policies I put in effect but also not something that is just done. When ever we are screen sharing in a public VC it is only from Staff to Staff. At no point do we share any information about this stuff. I would love to figure out where the proof is as well as to how Matt leaked his Direct Admin information because the password is just a bunch of dots for one and for two we get login notifications if it was accessed from a new IP. We take security very seriously and the fact all of you joined our server and within 3 hours came up with this tells me you have no proof other than the mishap of the WHMCS license.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6708"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2006"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"48483"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"6708","attributes":{"username":"RealHD","displayName":"RealHD","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/bYlfqa0Oyc26N8eY.png","slug":"RealHD","joinTime":"2022-08-14T01:49:07+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":8,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-08-15T00:34:14+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4603","attributes":{"username":"Hyperz","displayName":"Hyperz","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/k7jMQnyrSCQX5yQp.png","slug":"Hyperz"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2006","attributes":{"title":"J&M Hosting","slug":"2006-jm-hosting","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"48483","attributes":{"number":12,"createdAt":"2022-08-14T02:24:29+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2006/4\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"48475\">RealHD</a> There is not proof, I have multiple previous staff AND a previous owner of HostNexxus, who have witnessed matt (an employee at the time) committing such actions.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4603"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2006"}}}}]}

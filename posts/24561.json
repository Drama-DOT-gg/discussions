I could even recreate it myself. I say only the JS part, because it is only the JS part, even the switch i deleted it and made it default to dark theme.</p>\n\n<p>Please chirag, stop trying to feel special just for 6 public lines of JS.</p>\n\n<p>Now, taking advantage of the fact that there is a thread against you, and you were accusing me, I'm going to have a little fun.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629365285-308498-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n(All these referring to me, without letting even explain, begin toxic, getting angry when everyone agrees with me, and a long list of stuff)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-19/1629367272-330034-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nI though all multieggs got an ascii at start, and even your multiegg has the resource thingy, that means you skidded it?

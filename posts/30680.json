I have only used HostNexxus when the previous CEO was present (Alt). I cancelled my service with them, and 1 month after that cancellation, they still charged my card. The owner was very uncompliant until I had to talk about my personal life, and how I couldn't afford to lose $25 because my family medical bills, only then was he all of a sudden not extremely busy and turned off the \"Auto-Pay\" on PayPal that would have also charged my card the following month if it hadn't been turned off. The service I ordered didn't work anyways, hence why I cancelled with them, and their website was broken to the point that you couldn't even access your services, let alone your account. As-of the current reputation and present of this timeline, I cannot say whether to trust them or not, as I believe Alt sold the company to Cahill (new CEO). Otherwise Alt is a scumbag, lying, and overpricing shit bag.</p>\n\n<p>Here is some proof on Alt trying to sell a dedicated server to a client for</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/805940843193171987/808834816501612584/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/805940843193171987/808834891679793202/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>He pulled some really devious and despicable shit.

I know the guy and he actually is pretty genuine.

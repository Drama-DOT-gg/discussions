Firstly it took them over 2 months to buy whmcs from release and in that 2 months he made the excuse constantly he \"Had a social life too\". Yeh, and you wanna run a good business. He also uses a 16gb contabo node with a 4 vcore processor. He seems to think that AMD EPYC is just 1 cpu as he says they have an AMD EPYC cpu when people ask lol.<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-07/1615153467-77177-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe also is using a 1gb EC2 node from amazon as their US node<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-07/1615153521-940019-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nNice. Using a free VPS for your host. Also one of their ex-staff members downloaded my files from a server I had with them and took my bot token and everything (And it is a verified bot too.) <img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-07/1615153719-561745-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nJex also never stuck with any idea I gave and whenever I did try and push one like switching from 1.0 pterodactyl to 0.7 for addons and theming then he constantly accused me of being pushy. Whenever I threatened to leave as well he always blamed it on the fact that we weren't switching to 0.7 but instead it was because nothing had happened at all and I was getting bored. Also one of their current staff members has a DNDW role in the winterhoax discord. Jex also likes to bring up my past and other winterhoaxes that I have proven wrong like me using a website builder for someone, but he is yet to use that brain of his to see the evidence I showed him. I bet he will reply to this talking about my past lol. In conclusion, DO NOT buy from these guys, you get a shitty cpu from a shitty VPS that can barely handle 2 minecraft servers. (Discovered that one in my testing).</p>\n\n<p>Will post updated here.</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"254"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_","joinTime":"2020-12-13T20:34:09+00:00","discussionCount":8,"commentCount":425,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-25T17:08:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"254","attributes":{"title":"Dijx Cloud Platform","slug":"254-dijx-cloud-platform","isApproved":true}}]}

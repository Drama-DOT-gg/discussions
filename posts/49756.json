It just stupid how they behave. Telling people to downgrade to Windows 7 is stupid since it's still an EoL system. Of course it's better in my Opinion (I use Vista with Extended Kernel on my Second Laptop). But you shouldn't recommend that since basically if something happens to your System hes the fault. You cant do banking on Windows 7 and there aren't even secure Browsers except Firefox (at the end of the day they will also discontinue 7 like they did with XP and Vista). Windows 7 is just getting more far away of being a realistic Daily Operating system. If someone hates the new Windows Versions so much as me they should just switch to Linux or die in Depression using ReactOS.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7082"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2092"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"49762"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"7082","attributes":{"username":"Arkhan_Old_Acc_Deleted","displayName":"Arkhan_Old_Acc_Deleted","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/4U93z2T6Ymt8VN2c.png","slug":"Arkhan_Old_Acc_Deleted","joinTime":"2023-02-07T15:14:26+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":7,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-02-08T12:03:08+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"inkOBse7PZxmtIj6.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"New Account of Hampter (https://drama.gg/u/hampter) & Arkhan (https://drama.gg/u/Arkhan).\nI got banned from Discord for false reasons.\nContact: Arkhan#9142","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"5393","attributes":{"username":"Win","displayName":"Win","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Win"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2092","attributes":{"title":"Windows Support Community - Owners and Members treat you like shit","slug":"2092-windows-support-community-owners-and-members-treat-you-like-shit","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"49762","attributes":{"number":8,"createdAt":"2023-02-07T16:47:15+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2092/7\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"49756\">Arkhan_Old_Acc_Deleted</a> ok</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5393"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2092"}}}}]}

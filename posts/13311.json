He asked if he could help me with the new host I'm making. I agreed and let him become management, I later received a dm from one of my friends who informed me that CloudBud was \"immature\". My experience with CloudBud for the last 3 hours went against that, but I removed his management role and I went into his connected social media accounts. After searching for a while on drama.gg, I found his Tikok which is very <em>cringe</em> (<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.tiktok.com/</a>@[Some content here may have been removed by the Drama.gg team]?lang=en). [Update: He has deleted all his videos from his tiktok]. He posts several videos about him moving his camera over the announcements he makes on his discord server. I asked him about it and he claimed it was his brother, and his brother had his discord login info. I was skeptical, but I went along with it. One thing I found on his tiktok was that he was struggling to eat a single taki (JUST ONE). I left his tiktok which has now been deleted (all the videos have) which is very sus. I spent a while going through his twitter and found a bunch of weird stuff. But before I get into that, heres some more stuff. Before this whole thing, I asked him if he was a Roblox game developer, he said \"I don't, but my brother does\". I then went to his twitter and found several tweets going to games on roblox asking \"Can I develop for you\". Then, I asked him to invite me to Poly Hosting server (his host I think). He replied saying he deleted it/doesn't exist. I found the discord widget on his twitch and it showed people online on his server. I showed him that and he said, \"why do you want to join\". That was a big red flag. Now I'll show pictures and everything to let you know, (<strong><em>Btw, hes a furry</em></strong>)<br>\n<em>LINKS:</em> [Edit: He fucking deleted the twitter off his discord profile, I still have

request:<br>\n<code>200 USD for a discord bot list</code><br>\nThey didn't want to pay first and wanted me to put it on Glitch/Repl which you can see the code on.</p>\n\n<p>This alarmed me, but i did do it, so i made a screenshot (Blurring the project name &amp; id)<br>\nAfter this i deleted it and sent them the screenshot.<br>\nJust like i thought they wanted the link to see if it was the actual

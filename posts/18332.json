There are few misconceptions I would like to address throughout this thread.</p> \n\n<p>Firstly, it seems to be widely believed N-VPS utilizes docker in order to achieve its non-virtualized state, I do truly understand why people would jump to that conclusion as Ararat is Pterodactyl-based, and utilizes Pterodactyl's frontend, however, the backend in Ararat (for N-VPS's, not Minecraft) is fully custom and does not utilize Docker in any way, shape, or form. In fact, KVM support is coming to Ararat soon.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we do not have any official affiliation with badsk. In fact, this one's a funny story, before our Discord bot sent the welcome gifs, I would manually send them, and badsk wanted to see if I could send a ton of welcome gifs at the same time, so he tried to get a lot of people in at the same time to troll me ðŸ˜‚.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, we do not use any of Heimsnet's software in any way, shape, or form. I'm not sure where you concluded that from but that statement is just inaccurate.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Hye Hosting does not run on older hardware which our system \"makes run like on i9's\". We use genuine Intel Core i9-9900K hardware.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this clears up any misconceptions about our service,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Joseph - Hye Hosting Director</strong></p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3037"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"559"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"18366"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3037","attributes":{"username":"Hye","displayName":"Hye","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/cQ9hmctx050Rf1nh.png","slug":"Hye","joinTime":"2021-01-24T19:38:24+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":26,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-05-01T02:04:28+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2819","attributes":{"username":"KIVOX","displayName":"KIVOX","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/4Vk03N61lEPkE5IO.png","slug":"KIVOX"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"559","attributes":{"title":"Hyehosting is Back... | Hye/Endermined ","slug":"559-hyehosting-is-back-hyeendermined","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"18366","attributes":{"number":34,"createdAt":"2021-06-06T17:36:25+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/559/33\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"18332\">Hye</a> No one ever said you used docker containers, you and your staff just assume everyone means docker containers whenever the word \"container\" is mentioned.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2819"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"559"}}}}]}

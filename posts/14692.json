I have factual evidence to backup all of my claims which have been provided previously in the Discord server. If you're not a scumbag, PROVE that you are a legal entity, that you can program, that you're not toxic, that you're not violating PayPals AUP by selling Minecraft Products directly, that you didn't DDoS me, that you didn't pull my IP from your database. Either way, all reports have been submitted now.</p> ","editedAt":"2021-05-13T21:13:00+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3456"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3456"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"495"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3456","attributes":{"username":"samxd","displayName":"samxd","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/DN9JmlfzPUkAj29W.png","slug":"samxd","joinTime":"2021-04-26T13:32:14+00:00","discussionCount":4,"commentCount":104,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-02-24T02:55:54+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"495","attributes":{"title":"[Community Vote] Should Puggo be banned + removed permanently from Drama.gg?","slug":"495-community-vote-should-puggo-be-banned-removed-permanently-from-dramagg","isApproved":true}}]}

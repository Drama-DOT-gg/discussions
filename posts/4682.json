He's a deceiver and nothing more. Yesturday, Jay decided to ask for my companies number knowing that we aren't registered as we began operations about a week prior. I said that we are not yet registered and decided to ask for his company number, at this point Jay decided to appear offline and ignore my question I looked into the Navo Hosting discord and how funny, Jay was in a private office appearing offline what a coincidence as soon as I ask him for his company number he decides to appear offline? I repeatedly asked for the next day or two until he finally admitted that his company wasn't registered. After this, I decided to tell Alpha that Jay was basically lying to people about it, I gave Alpha the screenshot above and he decided to post it on Winterhoax (this thread..) I knew that Jay would be petty about it and do something like this so I asked Alpha to delete it but it's his choice he decided not to though he did atleast blur my name out. Anyway, at this point I have been banned from the Navo Hosting discord and my services have been deleted which I have paid for. Navo is not a registered company yet the owner implies that it is by showing terms of services etc etc. he can be very aggressive and overall unprofessional, for example he told me to calm down after he started being aggressive in a dm lmfaoo. He claims that a dm is completely related to his hosting company etc etc.</p> \n\n<p>Jay is one of the slower hosting provider owners, he leaked his own address on an image that was poorly covered up with marker on this very thread and he was pretty scared when I recited his address to him.</p> \n\n<p>Overall, Navo Hosting is a unprofessional, heap of garbage hosting provider. Stay away at all costs. Jay is a liar, deceiver, and he's immature. He fails to provide simple information and even declines free trials to specific people (but not all people) because their \"un-necessary\"  He's running a fraud company it's almost laughable.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a good bit of my dms with jay you'll have to ignore the timestamps etc. You <em>might</em> find some funky stuff in there. :)<br>\n<a href=\"https://pastebin.com/dXMuQ2t3\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://pastebin.com/dXMuQ2t3</a></p>\n\n<p>the navo discord would be right here<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-22/1611332303-701974-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>oh and their website is pretty broken too<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-01-22/1611332325-242863-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://prnt.sc/xgjr46\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://prnt.sc/xgjr46</a></p>\n\n","editedAt":"2021-01-22T16:20:55+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3021"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3021"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"154"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"4684"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3021","attributes":{"username":"WockySlush","displayName":"WockySlush","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/lbsO9BM9wW73JCfF.png","slug":"WockySlush","joinTime":"2021-01-21T01:24:23+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":50,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-01-25T13:27:55+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2994","attributes":{"username":"TMKC","displayName":"TMKC","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/UhcfducRdtHAy91f.png","slug":"TMKC"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"154","attributes":{"title":"NavoHosting-Scammers-Griefers-TiltedHost Resellers","slug":"154-navohosting-scammers-griefers-tiltedhost-resellers","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"4684","attributes":{"number":116,"createdAt":"2021-01-22T16:37:31+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/154/114\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"4682\">WockySlush</a> Your services where suspended due to breaking ToS.<br>\n<a href=\"https://navohosting.net/terms\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://navohosting.net/terms</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://navohosting.net/policy\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://navohosting.net/policy</a></p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\" start=\"7\"><li>Engage in unauthorized framing of or linking to the Site.</li>\n<li>Use any information obtained from the Site in order to harass, abuse, or harm another person.</li>\n<li>Harass, annoy, intimidate, or threaten any of our employees or agents engaged in providing any portion of the Marketplace Offerings to you.</li>\n<li>Disparage, tarnish, or otherwise harm, in our opinion, us and/or the Site.<br>\n23.Use the Site in a manner inconsistent with any applicable laws or regulations.</li></ol>\n\n<p>The site is currently being moved over to a new location, hense why it is showing \"Plesk Default Site\".<br>\nAnd leaking private messages is against alot of ToS since it is ment to be private, not public.</p>\n\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nPierre - C.O.O of NavoHosting Solutions</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2994"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"154"}}}}]}

You don't operate a corporation including you are not in control Sive to run a firm because of the simplistic reality you don't have good characters abilities you believe that you are constantly correct the day after Jen sold ownership of Holo yourself Jayen furthermore Jen &amp; Mtt &amp; Shroom were banned due to relationship with Jen after showing private chats you were only yonder to plead for money which you always arranged sometime out of your day to inquire. I was in Century for about a week Holo was breaking at its period. I was brought into holo to preserve the firm aka with financiers for which I settled 99.9% of all financial responsibilities bedsides a 3 dollar Cpanel simply before you came back after your initial discharge from Century Samco aka Co-Founder rehired you. I declared that I didn't require you beyond more durable 8 1/2 days after you send me a letter about how we didn't get that many MC Clients which we arranged people just didn't have questions then you demanded to be our financial advisor I'm not giving anyone access to my family millions so you want me to give you access to our money source which I'm not gonna give a bankrupt teenager admittance to my values that I established into Century Jen Ex CEO was fighting to keep Holo operating as you as his Financial Advisor haha by renting servers from other companies. Since he's no longer apart of my company I went out and paid for a dedicated server including then tunneled them over OVH hehe Century may not be the Best corporation for some people but that's their judgment moreover I can't change that although I'm dam certain that I'm not gonna pay kids to help another kid run their company hehe comparatively well as begging to be unbanned and begging to be my Financial Advisor. I think have seen some people say that I should close Century but I will not close it not today not tomorrow maybe in the future but that's not this moment I will not give up on my Current clients.

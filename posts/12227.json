It's not even anything proper and does not clarify a lot of things <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873329356996649/Screenshot_212.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873329356996649/Screenshot_212.png</a>. (Please correct me if I am wrong)</p>\n\n<p>They also claim to have datacentres, but are reselling Contabo &amp; OVH, and it's so obvious, its just sad to see him deny it. Specially after he, himself admitted it. The screen shot's contain him saying that they have datacentres, saying that they are partnered with Contabo and OVH after I said that their plans are the same as Contabo, him admitting to reselling Contabo &amp; OVH, then denying it <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873332876017674/Screenshot_215.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873332876017674/Screenshot_215.png</a> <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873329088954398/Screenshot_213.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873329088954398/Screenshot_213.png</a> <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873332980219924/Screenshot_214.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873332980219924/Screenshot_214.png</a> <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873336205639730/Screenshot_217.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/835873336205639730/Screenshot_217.png</a>. <br>\n(is he fine mentally?) Even if you were to say that they are not reselling Contabo/OVH, it does not make sense for a company with a total of 250 Discord members (not even customers) to have multiple datacentres, does it?</p>\n\n<p>They also have a website hosted on 000webhost, <a href=\"https://olympushostinger.000webhostapp.com/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://olympushostinger.000webhostapp.com/</a>. I am pretty sure it's their free plan. Also, they claim to sell domains, but don't even have a domain themselves. When I asked about it, he said that they are waiting for the developer to put it up with their new domain.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and their staff is unprofessional and can not even be bothered to capitalize the first letter of the sentence.</p>\n\n<p>They also just ignore the questions they do not want to answer.</p>\n\n<p>After this, I just got banned with no reason specified so I could not get anything else on them.</p>\n\n<p>I am sorry about some of the screen shots being glitched.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3351"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"412"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"12231"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3351","attributes":{"username":"MysteriousK69","displayName":"MysteriousK69","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/ABOR5lBU0cUCwlDP.png","slug":"MysteriousK69","joinTime":"2021-04-08T05:55:35+00:00","discussionCount":10,"commentCount":283,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-08-01T08:13:45+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Giving the best hosting at Lawliet.Host","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"412","attributes":{"title":"Olympus hosting | Improper tos | unprofessional staff | And, more.","slug":"412-olympus-hosting-improper-tos-unprofessional-staff-and-more","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"12231","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-04-25T14:09:33+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/412/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"12227\">MysteriousK69</a> They also have a website hosted on 000webhost, <a href=\"https://olympushostinger.000webhostapp.com/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://olympushostinger.000webhostapp.com/</a>.

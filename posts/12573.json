I'm all for supporting innovation, but this kind of thing was bound to happen.</p>\n\n<p>ItzAwesome (or whatever he goes by these days) is not apt to own or run a business, lest of all one that handles personally identifiable information.</p>\n\n<p>For one, you have the, in my opinion, insane level of unprofessionalism and clear flaunting of responsibility (more on that later). He's unable to take criticism or even begin responding to it civilly. He's cultured the same attitude in his staff team, muting and banning for the slightest criticism, their feigned sense of superiority might make some irate but I take solace in the fact, that, at the end of the day, most of them are still 11-year-olds whose understanding of pretty much any topic shall be very limited and who can't be expected to know how to treat someone with the slightest degree of professionalism.</p> \n\n<p>On to the \"hot topic\", the data leak.<br>\nFor those of us familiar with the matter, it wasn't a case of if this would happen it was a case of when this would happen, and how bad would it be.<br>\nI think the gravity of the situation impressed most of us, 200k unhashed passwords ItzAwesome is trying to give RockYou a run for their money. Thinking back he appears to be copying their MO.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Unhashed Passwords - Check</li>\n<li>Takes time to notify users of the breach - Check</li>\n<li>Privacy policy completely ignored when handling the breach - Check</li></ul>\n\n<p>Clearly, ItzAwesome understands nothing about handling people's sensitive data (as if it needed to be said) and when confronted with the possibility of a massive fine instantly registers a company in the US (#5841775 in the state of Delaware) and tries to dissolve the UK company.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know how he can still attempt to defend himself, this isn't slander, this is a description of current events.</p>\n\n<p>A note to ItzAwesome: Face the consequences of your actions, your cretinism caused this. You are inept to run a hosting company, you understand nothing of basic system security and don't have the discernment to hire those who do. People's data isn't a toy, and hopefully, the ICO will make you see this.</p>","editedAt":"2021-04-28T17:01:03+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3475"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3475"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"2"},{"type":"users","id":"2864"},{"type":"users","id":"3040"},{"type":"users","id":"3377"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"12724"},{"type":"posts","id":"12922"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3475","attributes":{"username":"SealMan","displayName":"SealMan","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"SealMan","joinTime":"2021-04-28T16:06:34+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":2,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-03-18T19:51:28+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2","attributes":{"username":"Sloth","displayName":"Sloth","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/6BdW7QU4UtMZIKtd.png","slug":"Sloth"}},{"type":"users","id":"2864","attributes":{"username":"leastile","displayName":"leastile","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/hrZzqfDkPKOK6y0p.png","slug":"leastile"}},{"type":"users","id":"3040","attributes":{"username":"YajTPG","displayName":"YajTPG","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"YajTPG"}},{"type":"users","id":"3377","attributes":{"username":"Korbs","displayName":"Korbs","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/CUD5vV2bKVwuF8sd.png","slug":"Korbs"}},{"type":"users","id":"3386","attributes":{"username":"Turnip","displayName":"Turnip","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/e9sBP3RxaPGMWVjR.png","slug":"Turnip"}},{"type":"users","id":"2840","attributes":{"username":"Ash777","displayName":"Ash777","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/zYHTsRFFOrAQT9Dt.png","slug":"Ash777"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"34","attributes":{"title":"Lamaker/ItzAwesome/Lily/Pamar | FalixNodes/Falix.gg & PrimeSRV","slug":"34-lamakeritzawesomelilypamar-falixnodesfalixgg-primesrv","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"12724","attributes":{"number":996,"createdAt":"2021-04-30T09:53:26+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/34/987\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"12573\">SealMan</a> absolutely  true statement right here</p>\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3386"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"12922","attributes":{"number":1009,"createdAt":"2021-05-02T06:43:14+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/34/987\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"12573\">SealMan</a> well lamaker was planing to make falix as a us company way before data breach</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2840"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}}]}

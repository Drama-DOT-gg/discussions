Also if you pay 30 cents per account why dont you provide a invoice proof and moreover why did you hesitate in telling me the license provider or even the IP of the server? and any explanations for deleting all your messages from my pms? why did you have to do that if you paid 30 cents an account. It does not make any sense my man.</p> \n\n<p>For a situation lets agree that you purchase accounts at 0.30$ but <strong>you sell it at 0.01515$ an account</strong> which is <strong>20 times less than the actual account cost</strong>. This is just not possible.</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"628"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"5","attributes":{"username":"Ryder","displayName":"Ryder","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/SMxzrW59P8Mu0jM0.png","slug":"Ryder","joinTime":"2020-07-10T05:42:08+00:00","discussionCount":4,"commentCount":166,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-07-23T09:11:51+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"K8K1q2nduUMEgPXP.jpg","cover_thumbnail":"thumbnails/K8K1q2nduUMEgPXP.jpg","canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Ryderasking","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"628","attributes":{"title":"Quackweb.co.uk - Modifying cPanel licensing file","slug":"628-quackwebcouk-modifying-cpanel-licensing-file","isApproved":true}}]}

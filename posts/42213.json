The progress on dashactyl is incredibly slow, and jamie's dashactyl egg is pure bullshit, the only part jamie did was like the main file and it's horrible, ok it might be jamie's first time trying out bash, but switch cases/cases exist in every single language which is not an esolang<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-25/1643097848-577140-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nthat has to be the worst code i've seen tbh</p>\n\n<p>and it's fairly clear that jamie does not know how to secure shit at all, the votion api for freenom is ez af to get since it's not even hard to deobfuscate his bash script, the api basically sends a message in a channel if a server tried to use a freenom domain, the api runs on port 6969, which is accessible by the public too so the ip and port <a href=\"http://193.110.160.171:6969/freenom-webhook\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">http://193.110.160.171:6969/freenom-webhook</a> with auth key which i'm not gonna reveal here, it's easily possible to spam pings in votion's egg logs channel if you have the header name which i probably have saved somewhere but cba to find it, just a simple axios request can do the job</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const axios = require('axios')\n\naxios.get(\"http://193.110.160.171:6969/freenom-webhook\", {\n    headers: {\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n        \"Accept\": \"application/json\",\n        \"Authorization\": \"SECRET TOKEN HERE\",\n        \"headernameoverhere\": \"@everyone\"\n    }\n})</code><script async=\"\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" data-hljs-style=\"github\" integrity=\"sha384-oTqfbnKDrROJYNQZI1U//Vr36HEjwJafOewSUYYyb5OXhv0r2qRQcjAP3yXa4HCg\" onload=\"hljsLoader.highlightBlocks(this.parentNode)\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/s9e/hljs-loader@1.0.24/loader.min.js\"></script></pre>\n<p>it's obviously insecure if anyone can ping every single staff member a billion times, i know i made the api, but port 6969 was supposed to be closed to the outside world, and only nginx should be accessing it. but jamie didn't give 2 shits about that. that clearly says how much jamie cares about security.<br>\nAbout jamie's shit code, even when i showed jamie that || exists in bash and i did change it myself since i know jamie's lazy, he somehow reverted back to this bullshit code:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-25/1643098954-198900-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2951"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"42214"},{"type":"posts","id":"42241"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2951","attributes":{"username":"Chirag","displayName":"Chirag","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/EBu92nGgi2Y9tYOD.png","slug":"Chirag","joinTime":"2020-12-05T08:46:40+00:00","discussionCount":19,"commentCount":790,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-10-27T20:47:30+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"A random doge\n","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1118","attributes":{"title":"Dashactyl Support","slug":"1118-dashactyl-support","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"42214","attributes":{"number":229,"createdAt":"2022-01-25T08:24:45+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1118/228\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"42213\">Chirag</a> most of this isn't confidential information btw, you can see the request url if you use a network monitor, something like wireshark or whatever the hell it was, his script is pretty easy to deobfuscate too.<br>\nno tl;dr for you, read it all</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2951"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"42241","attributes":{"number":249,"createdAt":"2022-01-25T15:33:17+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1118/228\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"42213\">Chirag</a> didn't give 2 shits about that. that clearly says how much jamie cares about security.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>What difference would it have made? Nginx just proxypasses it so it goes to the same place. That makes no sense. Plus, you say Dashactyl support is still toxic, look at the original thread. It is literally about <strong>you</strong> being toxic in the support channels.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}}}}]}

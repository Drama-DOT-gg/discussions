If anything, we are under selling, that is why i was looking for partners to help me get customers.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-04-30/1651294442-908547-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nNode 1</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-04-30/1651294462-960190-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nNode 2</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-04-30/1651294509-749633-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nNode 3</p> \n\n<p>Is our WHMCS Backdoored? No, if you need to have proof i will send you the proof once i dig it out of my emails</p>\n\n<p>Do i abuse hetzner? <br>\nNo, I don't. I have always hated plex for doing it and i also have the receipts if you need them.</p> \n\n<p>Do i have a tos and a pp? Yes, i do, although tthey are old and need to be updated, they are practical and still valid, and i am almost 1 month away from opening an actual LLC.</p>\n\n<p>Do i have botter reviews? <br>\nNo, why would i need to? The 1 review accoutns you see are the customers i asked to review the service. Of course not everyone uses TrustPilot, so they only have 1 review. Even my staff has reviews on it because at some point they did end up purchasing a server.</p> \n\n\n<p>Why do i have premium specs on my budget plans? <br>\nSimply put, the budget servers are being uploaded on the premium nodes and if you are a customer purchasing with us at argon, that is the first tyhing you will hear. That is because i haven't had the time to deploy my contabo nodes. So no, i am not lying when i say i am using premium hardware for the budget plan. Granted, that isn't gonna be forever</p>\n\n<p>Now, a last bit of advice. <br>\nI understand hating on plex, i mean he is a piece of shit, he deserves the worst. But when you try to drama,gg someone who has been in here since October, please find something i can actually fix and not criticism like \"Website Ugly!!!\"<br>\nAlso also, i have a section in my discord that is directed toward drama.gg members, stating that i am open to free constructyive criticism and that if you find something that can be fixed, we will at least look into it and if it is a seriopus issue we will fix it.</p> \n\n<p>Wish you guys the best</p>\n<ul><li>The Alex#2121</li></ul>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4955"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1907"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"47335"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4955","attributes":{"username":"TheAlex","displayName":"TheAlex","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/QCemA07tJA7U6C54.png","slug":"TheAlex","joinTime":"2021-11-28T23:02:52+00:00","discussionCount":4,"commentCount":91,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-10-16T08:55:25+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"I own Argon Hosting kekw","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4956","attributes":{"username":"FlyingMane","displayName":"FlyingMane","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/y78lnLq7MLPbrr4G.png","slug":"FlyingMane"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1907","attributes":{"title":"ArgonHosting.net","slug":"1907-argonhostingnet","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"47335","attributes":{"number":39,"createdAt":"2022-04-30T05:07:44+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1907/38\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"47334\">TheAlex</a> correction from mobile: one hardware (the Canada one) on the budget nodes is wrong, will change once i get home</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4956"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1907"}}}}]}

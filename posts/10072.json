He's only like 14 so obviously he is just using his parents money and doing stupid idiotic things.</p>\n\n<p>So when I was in BombHost I wanted to donate to get some resources. I donated got some resources but guess what the next day all our files are gone and BombHost is dommed. Then it reopened again got my resources back and in like 3 days all our files are gone because of his childish actions. Him Edward and idk other people had this court thing going and he clearly lost it.</p>\n\n<p>After that Aces left BombHost and he was no longer owner I made a dispute on paypal demanding for a refund and he pulled out the refund policy which I clearly met.

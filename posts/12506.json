And about how the current situation of the Staff is:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>The punishments and some minimum rules have changed, and I warned everyone about it, as I asked for the entire staff's opinion before making the change. Now, when you repeat a rule-breaker in a short period of time, it will have a greater punishment. This prevents people from being banned and having big mod logs.</p>\n\n<p>One of the only rules I asked for change (which I already warned that it wasn't to have punishments) was to talk about other hosts since many times this depends on hypocrisy; someone could speak well of Falix but going against another host and not be muted. Still, in a situation where he only quotes the host, he is muted.</p>\n\n<p>Drama.gg has never been and doesn't need to be considered as a suspicious site, considering that here never had and not even provides links with users' data <em>(if it has, it will no longer be allowed to talk about Drama. gg)</em>. Anything against this should be considered an opinion that cannot be against the rules, as this site does not apply.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the behavior of the entire staff, including support and management, I consider that nowadays there are only a few problems between us, considering that we no longer have personal problems between members and not even arguments, making it a peaceful environment (of course there is still a lot of work to be done, and I am working on it). I want to clean up what is expected of the Falix moderation.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Thanks for the consideration</em></p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3175"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"12635"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3175","attributes":{"username":"ely","displayName":"ely","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/uQHlc6TKjTtLggmz.png","slug":"ely","joinTime":"2021-03-04T21:40:50+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":14,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-04-17T03:38:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"Zzq5zEO7fwEhhesD.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3033","attributes":{"username":"_MrKnight_","displayName":"_MrKnight_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/kaGjEYVq3iidrUkK.png","slug":"_MrKnight_"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"34","attributes":{"title":"Lamaker/ItzAwesome/Lily/Pamar | FalixNodes/Falix.gg & PrimeSRV","slug":"34-lamakeritzawesomelilypamar-falixnodesfalixgg-primesrv","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"12635","attributes":{"number":991,"createdAt":"2021-04-29T06:08:59+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/34/982\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"12506\">ely</a> there is a thing called update ping. do it when u update rule as we cant check rules 24/7</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3033"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}}]}

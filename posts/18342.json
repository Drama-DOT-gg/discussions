I got both of their POV's when I asked ZonieTV for proof to be innocent he only sent one screenshot with Racco insulting him (Which ZonieTV started) which didn't proof anything. And he could not send more. He also tries to expose people without reason. Asks everyone for help (How to create a dashboard with js, without having any js experience). Also trying to copy other people and being really childish about it. Even trying to go as far as to retire from a staff team and leave a discord server to try to do it. (They did not succeed). Also they are probably underage ( under 13 ). He also has a lot of personality changes. When racco did not respond for 2 hours he went from really caring to \"I thought u were my friend\" now with that out of the way here are some of my personal experiences: <img src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/a8244bebe528cdbca0d28e6a91186e4a.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"1\"> <br>\nhim being childish:<br>\n<img src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/efcbc680d9dd2e4cdf7b91179be7bac6.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nhim complaining about me adding a rule to our TOS:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-06/1622992886-618767-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nhim complaining about being demoted for advertising and causing drama<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-06/1622993055-327431-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I could go on about this for hours, just stay away from him.</p>\n\n<p>He was on here before with a hosting company called ProLema (AKA SalioNodes) it was on here for<br>\nbad services, scam and illegal operation.

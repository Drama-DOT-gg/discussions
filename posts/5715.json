They have gone to court many times, and FiveM finds a loop hole each time. Rockstar is still currently going after them. It's a great game, we all enjoy it, and I don't want it gone.

I agree, other companies shouldn't do it, but legally, they can if they want.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3079"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"180"}}}}]}

I am 100% sure its copy pasted from somewhere else. They say that they will tell the users what information is being collected and why, but it never is. In the next ss, it says that they will receive information such as email, name, etc. When we contact them, but that's not possible, because you can only contact them through Discord. They also claim to use Google adsense, but they clearly do not have it on their website.

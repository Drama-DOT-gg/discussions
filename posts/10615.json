Basically they are using you as their servant. Br tough you deserve better. You can find way better friends than them. You gonna learn nothing from them cuz you ddint even knew what p2w was. Find some good friends who can teach you stuff and be with you instead of using you</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3358"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"359"}}}}]}

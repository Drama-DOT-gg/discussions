The owner is really chill and does the best he can. We recently launched a new node and I can confirm it has been having a ton of load since the day It became public. And as far as I'm aware we have a paid node for users who pay us.</p>\n\n<p>We are also aware of the YouTube Channel thumbnail situation, others are working on it.</p>\n\n<p>I have some questions for you, I would be glad if you would answer them.</p>\n\n<p>1) The tags you have entered. \"Illegal Activites\" and \"Scammers\" how do they relate to us? <br>\n2) How exactly does the owner \"FORCING STAFFS TO DO WORK\" matter to you?<br>\n3) Are you a paid user? When you are talking about the nodes being overloaded are you referring to the paid node?<br>\n4) Could we talk more about this on discord along with the other staffs?</p>\n","editedAt":"2021-09-23T12:30:31+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4201"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4201"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1031"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"29556"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4201","attributes":{"username":"Aaron_","displayName":"Aaron_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/jjT3NoTeKl684ba2.png","slug":"Aaron_","joinTime":"2021-08-18T10:22:33+00:00","discussionCount":13,"commentCount":996,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-09-16T15:48:40+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"VzViYix1qU8tqLyW.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1031","attributes":{"title":"DARYNODES SCAMMER, HIGH PRICES FOR DISK,  FORCING STAFFS TO DO WORK","slug":"1031-darynodes-scammer-high-prices-for-disk-forcing-staffs-to-do-work","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"29556","attributes":{"number":25,"createdAt":"2021-09-25T06:25:58+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1031/6\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"29351\">Aaron_</a> dary nodes has scammed MEhost and has not paid for the dedicated server provided to them by mehost</p>"},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1031"}}}}]}

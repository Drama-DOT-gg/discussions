The fact that I just said „gimme a min” „im scamming a kid” „from 100 usd” and I didn't provide any image proof in DMs that I actually was doing that. It was so funny seeing you attach the image containing that lmfao.</li>\n<li>Bad Services - MJCloud isn't a bad service. We have over 99% uptime, backups on an off-site storage server. Soon we might even provide 1 core of i9-9900K for free!</li>\n<li>Illegal Activities &amp; Illegal Operations - I think this is about the no ToS &amp; PP thing, well you can still access the old ToS and PP. The new one will be released tomorrow or today, as I said before.</li></ol>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3179"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"555"}}}}]}

Everyone says it was a joke after performing sins. You thinking creating those rules are joke where people don't have freedom of speech? And the owner literally says it's my server I have rights to ban you. And the owner literally even banned people for no freaking reason. And you call all that a joke?

You ain't going away by giving shitty excuse</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2801"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"359"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2801","attributes":{"username":"DeadBush","displayName":"DeadBush","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/XbjcjyJPwRXjAX5J.png","slug":"DeadBush","joinTime":"2020-09-13T20:26:47+00:00","discussionCount":16,"commentCount":295,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-10-07T06:26:03+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"I'm DeadBush","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"359","attributes":{"title":"Scuffed MC server and Owner.

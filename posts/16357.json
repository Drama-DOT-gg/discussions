The fact that I just said „gimme a min” „im scamming a kid” „from 100 usd” and I didn't provide any image proof in DMs that I actually was doing that. It was so funny seeing you attach the image containing that lmfao.</li>\n<li>Bad Services - MJCloud isn't a bad service. We have over 99% uptime, backups on an off-site storage server. Soon we might even provide 1 core of i9-9900K for free!</li>\n<li>Illegal Activities &amp; Illegal Operations - I think this is about the no ToS &amp; PP thing, well you can still access the old ToS and PP. The new one will be released tomorrow or today, as I said before.</li></ol>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3179"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"555"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"16359"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3179","attributes":{"username":"honk","displayName":"honk","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/sSMWNbIdNt1e9Ckk.png","slug":"honk","joinTime":"2021-03-05T13:13:35+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":87,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-08-31T21:28:21+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":".","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3257","attributes":{"username":"RumGuru","displayName":"RumGuru","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/LfdbF5Ex7oM05L6h.png","slug":"RumGuru"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"555","attributes":{"title":"MJCloud - honk #9930 - /toxic/underage/no tos&pp/scamming","slug":"555-mjcloud-honk-9930-toxicunderageno-tosppscamming","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"16359","attributes":{"number":120,"createdAt":"2021-05-24T10:31:34+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/555/118\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"16357\">honk</a> You said it and then later after couple of hours you say \"im joking\"<br>\nThats stupid why didnt you say \"im joking\" right after<br>\nHow do i know that you are not lying?<br>\n i never mentioned uptime or quality, i just said you are treating customers bad</p>\n <ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\" start=\"3\"><li>First that domain is not mjcloud domain, and you were working without tos for month</li></ol>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3257"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"555"}}}}]}

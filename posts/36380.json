I quickly realized it was because I had an old account with him from <em>a long time ago</em> and I politely asked him to remove my data. He then quickly replies asking me to make a ticket. I do so and ask him to ask someone to view it as I do not feel comfortable with my data on his systems at all. He then accused me of using the VPSs for DDoSing out of the blue. This is not true and they were instead for a Discord Bot project named Tyro (Which I am still developing). I then just wait and get a reply asking why I wanted my data to be removed. See attached images below for my response.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-29/1638226451-857439-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n(Don't worry about the IP, its my openVPN servers IP.)</p>\n\n<p>And I kid you not, I cannot make this up, the operator replies with the following:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-29/1638226532-741245-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nEither they have extremely unexperienced and uneducated operators, or they are just straight up lying.</p> \n\n<p>Here is my reply to this:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-29/1638226621-874169-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nAttached image on the ticket reply:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-29/1638226633-852918-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>So now we wait. Will they refuse to delete my data again? I will keep this post updated. I also wait to point out that when this account was made, I put N/A for the address as I would trust a hitman more with my address than this guy, and again, I cannot make this up, he proceeded to change the address on my account to the address he <em>thinks</em> I live at. It again makes his maturity shine through.</p>\n\n<p>I have also just found that he was confronted about his website having the colorlib copywrite removed, he ignored it. He accused chirag of changing the subject but actually did himself.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-29/1638226819-691900-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-29/1638226863-456230-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Link to messages:</strong> <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/894-chirag-eggactyl/103\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://drama.gg/d/894-chirag-eggactyl/103</a></p>\n\n<p>I will update when I get a reply from them.</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"909"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_","joinTime":"2020-12-13T20:34:09+00:00","discussionCount":8,"commentCount":425,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-25T17:08:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"909","attributes":{"title":"abdullah.#0001 | DDoSer | Threatening to DOX | Lots of downtime on company","slug":"909-abdullah0001-ddoser-threatening-to-dox-lots-of-downtime-on-company","isApproved":true}}]}

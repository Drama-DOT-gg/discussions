They have all been told they are on thin ice and I have been suffering with covid for the last week so have not seen what they have been doing. Besides, your the one pointing fingers at me! I haven't said a thing to anyone to make them nuke their VPS. Also it was like this even before I owned dashactyl. I saw it all the time.</p>\n\n<p>Sort out your attitude mate, you didn't used to be like this. Read through an entire post first before attacking them like that. It makes you look bad, and a lot of other people support what dashactyl is doing.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}}}}]}

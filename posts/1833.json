Still haven't gotten paid for my fucking 1 year of my life/work. Seems to be making up excuses. Not gonna make any assumtions so don't take this statement as a confirmation, but I'm getting pretty pissed off right now. You can't just be like ooohh tomorrow, ohhhh not today, tomorrow every day for something as big as this. Also I already set out plans on where I'm investing that money into Heimsnet. How am I supposed to do that if he doesn't pay in time? Everything in my life is pretty much getting destroyed from this deal at this point.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"51"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"83"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"51","attributes":{"username":"Endermined","displayName":"Endermined","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Kdz0fHiyfCKmLqFE.png","slug":"Endermined","joinTime":"2020-07-30T14:15:40+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":126,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-03-23T16:30:28+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Owner of Hye Hosting https://hyehosting.com","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"83","attributes":{"title":"SnowyHosting, BombHosting & OrbitNodes |  Rectrox/RoseyMC","slug":"83-snowyhosting-bombhosting-orbitnodes-rectroxroseymc","isApproved":true}}]}

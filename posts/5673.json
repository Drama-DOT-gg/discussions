Don't send her this thread  if possible either she does have my IP from a recent thing that happened. She'll recognize my name. Anyway, the best thing to do is block her and request a refund on PayPal don't accept any invoices and such obviously.</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3036"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"147"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3077"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"5771"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3036","attributes":{"username":"Vanquish","displayName":"Vanquish","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/fggUflkAbpVpGb63.png","slug":"Vanquish","joinTime":"2021-01-24T17:51:40+00:00","discussionCount":14,"commentCount":360,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-06-02T04:07:54+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"i do stuff","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3077","attributes":{"username":"gothicflufflepuff","displayName":"gothicflufflepuff","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"gothicflufflepuff"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"147","attributes":{"title":"Century Hosting | Watzon","slug":"147-century-hosting-watzon","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"5771","attributes":{"number":105,"createdAt":"2021-02-03T15:16:38+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/126/83\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"5673\">Vanquish</a> She knows about the thread, She did a \"response to remers\" video and posted it in her support section on the century hosting discord... but I think it's a private link because I can't find it on her channel but she was on this post, and on the other site and addressing all the posts and going into dms and addressing everything..</p> \n\n<p>Funniest Thing EVER that I'd like to add, is that She keeps sending me an invoice, yet I paid for a month of service on the 30th, so both yesterday and this morning I woke up to an invoice in my inbox but since the afternoon on the 31st I've had this show up...</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-03/1612364889-624672-inkedsuspendedserver-li.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Sorry for Inking out the name of my roleplay server don't need that gremlin harrassing me further.. so my services are suspended but She wants more money from me? Yeah right nice try.</p> \n\n<p>Also She said I wouldn't get my refund from century back and with all the evidence I submitted to paypal in less than 12 hours they voted in my favor and I got my refund and she keeps trying to send me friend requests but I ignore them because I honestly have nothing to say to her at all.</p> \n\n<p>I want nothing to do with her sad excuse of a company and if She doesn't stop trying to add me and doesn't stop sending me invoices, My mother works with the police department where I'm from and I'll be making a call and finding out where this clown is from and letting the police know what She is up to with all her hacking, ddos attacks, ip stressors, porn hub premium accounts that are stolen, the developers are already serving stuff for her reselling their stuff without having reselling rights because she is profiting off of something she has no right to profit from so I don't care if this person is 15, 16, 18, 21, 25 whatever age I've been hearing and I certainly dont care if they are a man or woman cause they certainly sound like a man in their YouTube videos they are going to get into some legal trouble.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3077"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"147"}}}}]}

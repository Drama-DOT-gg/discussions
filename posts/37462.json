Most free hosts are made by \"kids\"(as everyone calls them) who dont have actual \"investment\". Free hosts dont make as much revenue as most free trial providers cost, neither adsense or arc is going to generate enough revenue even if all of their members afk / click ads.  If you have seen no \"legit\" free host has grown enough as to pay for even hetzner nodes (cheapest reputable dedi provider out there). Exception being falix which used to abuse hetzner and ionos payment systems.<br>\nThe threads are mainly to tell people to avoid them. I havent created any actual threads but just contributed to them cause i deem these small hosts as \"irrelevant\". Most of us here on this forum have commonsense that you seem to lack as to you trying to be formal on a forum. \"Trying\" as to just copy pasting a format while having multiple grammatical mistakes in your \"posts\". Also being a \"hypocrite\" as to you asking people to provide evidence while you dont and avoid talking about something you cant reply to(this i fair enough) but calling out shershah for ignoring a line which he couldnt reply to.</p>","editedAt":"2021-12-09T10:32:37+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3262"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3262"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1281"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3262","attributes":{"username":"Soul","displayName":"Soul","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/kWnM8aLFOe2uIpyb.png","slug":"Soul","joinTime":"2021-03-25T11:32:10+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":108,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-05-20T03:37:04+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"a idiot","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1281","attributes":{"title":"Xite Nodes Scam | Overloaded Nodes, Abusing Free trials, Ddosing other hosts, ","slug":"1281-xite-nodes-scam-overloaded-nodes-abusing-free-trials-ddosing-other-hosts","isApproved":true}}]}

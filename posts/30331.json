Donators (who <strong>donated</strong> for their node), waited for months, and then dan announced he was gonna reset the node, some nodes have been offline for weeks. I'm not saying dan doesn't care about the host or stuff, he does plus he has a job aswell, but he has to put some sort of limit to the servers a user can own so the nodes don't get flooded with servers.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3493"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1071"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3493","attributes":{"username":"FC5570","displayName":"FC5570","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/AWzegFTT7Rn8lLrQ.png","slug":"FC5570","joinTime":"2021-05-02T10:50:44+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":50,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-04-10T15:17:47+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"this is a bio","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1071","attributes":{"title":"DBH Scummy Hosting","slug":"1071-dbh-scummy-hosting","isApproved":true}}]}

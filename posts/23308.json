This obviously results in most hosts shutting down within less than a month, due to one or more of a whole array of reasons. Adding onto your point about resources, if you don't have the money to start a host you shouldn't even be trying, as I know from <em>current</em> experience that if you are not making money someway or another you just won't succeed. A lot of people also think that branding the pterodactyl panel differently with custom themes sets them apart, but really it just puts you down $5 since most people dunno how to make them and so they end up buying them off people offline.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3008"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"716"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3008","attributes":{"username":"Aesthetical","displayName":"Aesthetical","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/w4S1fx2SzjxEq0UM.png","slug":"Aesthetical","joinTime":"2021-01-20T02:37:07+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":4,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-08-27T15:01:35+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"716","attributes":{"title":"Stop.

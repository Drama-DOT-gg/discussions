Reselling a cloud service is not illegal but highly immorala nd any host that resells free trials should be banned off hosting servers forever.

Considering most hosts using free trials are free host or are paid hosts which like 2 customers it's impossible for them to pay those invoices if they use gcp, AWS, azure etc. What's actually wrong with using free trials for hosting is that your users will lose data, since most of these shit heads won't be able to pay able the free trial ends, the data of their users would be lost forever.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2951"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1404"}}}}]}

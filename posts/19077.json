(realistically, $60 per month when calculated, but I am being generous). it is not realistic nor possible that you can offer these solutions, and hey retard, theres something called editing cpanel licensing files, so if you pick up that 5 gram head of yours and admit \"i fucked up\" and dont null cpanel again, maybe i and others will have respect for you, you dirty fucking scammy retarded scumbag.<br>\nI have reported your website to the government of my country and your country, have reported it to all known hosting providers you used, and filed some piracy reports. Good luck, you'll be shitting your pants when your buyers lose access!</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3771"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"628"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"19083"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3771","attributes":{"username":"anonymous0","displayName":"anonymous0","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"anonymous0","joinTime":"2021-06-05T14:13:49+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":20,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-07-27T21:44:29+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3249","attributes":{"username":"LordDioski","displayName":"LordDioski","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/pmQ2L1KZ9Ks3XIZa.png","slug":"LordDioski"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"628","attributes":{"title":"Quackweb.co.uk - Modifying cPanel licensing file","slug":"628-quackwebcouk-modifying-cpanel-licensing-file","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"19083","attributes":{"number":12,"createdAt":"2021-06-17T05:55:52+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/628/11\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"19077\">anonymous0</a> Wait a minute, who are you?</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3249"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"628"}}}}]}

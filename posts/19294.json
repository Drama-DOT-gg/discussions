He was going to help me pay my server, and he needed to order dedicated servers on Hetzner, and he gave me his bank details , so I thought he was legit. I made him promise that he wouldn't touch any other servers besides the one he ordered. The first invoice (with all of his servers and my servers) totaled up to 195 euros. The day the invoice was due, he sent my friend this DM, <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624085499-984506-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n I got scared and I confronted him, I did not want to lose my hosting, I've been working on it for over 4 months, and I did not want to lose it. I asked him subtly without telling him that my friend sent that screenshot. <br>\n <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624085734-89196-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n  He continues to talk:<br>\n  <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624085773-629235-image.png\" title=\"\"> <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624085912-306403-image.png\" title=\"\"> <br>\n(censoring someones name, he doesn't want to be mentioned). And then he says that it was a prank: <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624086051-545086-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n And that he will expose the person who exposed him on drama.gg. I don't get it, drama.gg isn't that big of a deal, he takes drama.gg way to seriously. After I give him another chance, the invoice seemed to get paid. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624086189-530153-image.png\" title=\"\"> But about 4 days later, I get this: <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624086263-306119-image.png\" title=\"\"> <br>\nIt didn't pay, which means that either Mitchell provided me with fake a IBAN. The next day, I get an email saying that my email was removed from the hetzner account, and he makes a fake email to impersonate my friend, (the one who doesn't want to be mentioned). He blames everything on my friend.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624086379-233497-image.png\" title=\"\"> <br>\nAnd he says this: <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624086397-552784-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n He removed my email, so I asked him if he did. And he said that my friend did, and he gave access to my hetzner account to my friend because he was \"sleepy\", and make him pay it and do the work for him. I ask him for a screenshot of his email, saying that his email was removed, and he sends me this:<br>\n <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-19/1624086503-215822-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n  He gives me an email of my friends name, but its a fake email. Its my friends name with a bunch of random numbers. This means that he created a fake email, to impersonate my friend. I ask my friend if its his email, and he sends me proof of his actual email, and confirm that Mitchell sent a fake email to me. He then says that it was him, and he had ordered his dedicated servers for his hosting he was working on, and I was helping him. We were going to be partners in a way, but then he says, \"Blurple Host was only an operation to get your hetzner account and delete it.\" I convince him to give my hetzner account back. Somehow he did. But he ordered 2 dedicated servers on my account, so I'm left with a 195 euro bill, and I cannot pay that, I only have money for my own server. He says he cannot pay it, his \"parents\" wont allow him. 17 year old, and can't even use his own money. My only chance is that hetzner accepts my cancellation, and changes the invoice to <strong>my</strong> servers invoice. <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Mitchell\" class=\"UserMention\">@Mitchell</a> #0002 did all this, he ruined everything, he's lied to me, made fake accounts impersonating my friend, he threatens me to put me on drama.gg (though I don't know what he'll put, I do everything legit, all my accounts are under my dads name, and all of my money goes to his bank. I do everything with his consent.), he tries to blackmail me, he can't keep his promises. If hetzner does not change the invoice price, I will have to cancel my hosting. I will be so depressed, if that happens, I have worked over 4 months on it. I am writing this thread so no one else will get in contact with him and get a similar experience as I did.</p>\n","editedAt":"2021-06-19T07:51:04+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3834"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3834"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"718"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"30"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3834","attributes":{"username":"Mad","displayName":"Mad","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/8IYl29CnOBnt7kwW.png","slug":"Mad","joinTime":"2021-06-19T06:30:29+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":10,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-08-08T12:26:23+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"30","attributes":{"username":"Triassic","displayName":"Triassic","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/vpuY80JJaf7LHX7q.png","slug":"Triassic"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"718","attributes":{"title":"Mitchell #0002 Scams 195 Euros.","slug":"718-mitchell-0002-scams-195-euros","isApproved":true}}]}

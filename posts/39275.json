About the memes, there is a channel about that but your shitty moderation don’t punish people for posting stuff wich should be in another channel and it is childish. About Dan ddosing and threating to sue it is a fact. As I mentioned DanBot Hosting did a Cease and Desist against Listed.Host for copyright infringement. And posting reviews of other people opinion about the host and posting facts isnt good?

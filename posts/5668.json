Then She tries to send me an invoice this morning at 4am? like heck am I having anything to do with that company or her, She keeps trying to friend me on discord it's getting really quite annoying. I saw her typing something so I'm going to assume that she has typed a message so that the second I accept her friend request she can send it.. I'm not as dumb as her to go and accept her friend request,</p>\n\n<p>I wish there was a way to warn people to not join her discord because I've heard She has people join her discord just to get their IP Addresses which really wouldn't surprise me in the slightest..</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3077"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"147"}}}}]}

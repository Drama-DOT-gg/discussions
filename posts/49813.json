Also about the unregistered sole prop, by a google search you need permits/licenses to operate. Also the fact that this isn't \"sole\" ownership, as he has 2 other C-class (if that's what it's called) owners/partners, check their website for that if you wish.</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4739"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"49815"},{"type":"posts","id":"49816"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4739","attributes":{"username":"TheYeetster","displayName":"TheYeetster","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Bzg1ypsYeixFBMGH.png","slug":"TheYeetster","joinTime":"2021-10-29T17:14:08+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":146,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-03-12T21:57:04+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"7096","attributes":{"username":"Pengu","displayName":"Pengu","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/1eQRNFMALLaeH1YR.png","slug":"Pengu"}},{"type":"users","id":"7004","attributes":{"username":"Young","displayName":"Young","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/jjOfAwYfyJgg1Yl7.png","slug":"Young"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2115","attributes":{"title":"Galactiq - A facade of Fraud and Theft","slug":"2115-galactiq-a-facade-of-fraud-and-theft","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"49815","attributes":{"number":13,"createdAt":"2023-02-19T20:03:44+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2115/11\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"49813\">TheYeetster</a> Also I'm not eligible to pay taxes on Galactiq as we don't make enough money annually or per month ðŸ™‚</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7096"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"49816","attributes":{"number":14,"createdAt":"2023-02-19T20:04:25+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2115/11\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"49813\">TheYeetster</a></p> \n\n<p>Me when my teacher ask for sources on my 4-paragraph essay:<br>\n<code>(according to some of my contacts)</code></p>\n\n\n<p>So one thing I am seeing is the confusion between the words \"sole prop\" and \"partnership\".<br>\nYou claim to be a former CEO of the company but Pengu is also CEO? ok?</p>\n\n<p>Sole Prop. is where there is just <strong>ONE OWNER</strong><br>\nPartnership is where there are <strong>MORE THAN ONE OWNER</strong></p>\n\n<p>If Pengu was the CEO-CEO (CEO of CEOs because fuck idk what this company is), then he would have the right to fire you. (as well as remove your assets that are associated with the company)</p>\n\n<p>However, I am falling under the assumption that this was a \"partnership\" not a \"sole prop\" because you claim that:</p>\n<ul><li>you hosted some of clients for the hosting company</li>\n<li>and you stated you were formal \"ceo\"</li></ul>\n\n<p>In a case like that,  usually people make contracts to work together as CEOs and if one decides to break the contract then it is voided. Since Pengu is a minor, no contract can ever be made.<br>\n(Because people in this hosting community likes to work with underaged people instead of business-educated people)</p>\n\n<p>As for the data leaks, this is a serious problem that can't be treated unnoticed. The fact that someone managed to get access inside the hosting company (even after being fired) shows the vulnerability and liability this company has.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7004"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}}}}]}

Just how bad is it?</strong></h3>\n<ul><li>To start, they do not know or have any dashboard setup and thus users need to create tickets to make servers. This is a horrible system straight up.</li>\n<li>It is running on google cloud, most likely a free trial. They refused to show the nodes' IPs or specifications to <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/rhys\" class=\"UserMention\">@rhys</a>, any host should not have problems with this, further proving that they are possibly using a Google‚Ñ¢ Cloud free trial.</li>\n<li>There's no actual website, the owner claims the panel is the \"website\". <a href=\"https://panel.2l2b.ml/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">(Click here to open)</a>.</li>\n<li>Banning users for no reason completely.</li>\n<li>And now, their admins have recently tried to bypass the dashactyl blacklist <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Jamie_\" class=\"UserMention\">@Jamie_</a> put in place for them.</li></ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Legal Documents.</strong></h3>\n<ul><li>(Hosted on WIX) <em>I think it's pretty clear but I'm gonna say it again, more evidence of them not having money to pay for actual nodes and using free trials!</em> TOS / PP thing <a href=\"http://qloxhostprivacypolicy.tk/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">http://qloxhostprivacypolicy.tk/</a> (Really weird and messed up, seems like they combined the two in one).</li>\n<li>Capitals have been wrongly placed everywhere over the TOS / PP document.</li>\n<li>Grammar is not at its best, I can't call it moderate, perhaps the effect of having been written by an 11-year-old. Just saying. Also uses too many \"till\" style words.</li></ul>\n\n<h3><strong>The owner...</strong></h3>\n<p>This is a deep rabbit hole so let's get to it.</p>\n<ul><li>The owner does not like the use of  VPNs to mask your IP address. They also save them and most possibly sell them.</li>\n<li>He is abusive; he tends to ping everyone constantly for no good reason and as <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Thominek\" class=\"UserMention\">@Thominek</a> mentioned <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/967-qloxhost-freenom-domain-advertising-in-servers/35\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">here</a> he also says words just like \"penis\" whilst at it.</li>\n<li>Has publicly announced I quote \"want to help qloxhost get better nodes and stuff like that just support please sign up at [REDACTED] it will make the bitcoin miner faster meaning I get more money meaning better nodes! u can also use this [REDACTED]\" <em>[REDACTED] = Cryptocurrency mining web sites.</em></li></ul>\n\n<p><del>### <strong>(11/11/21) Invite Rewards.</strong></del><br>\n<del>Straight up prohibited by Discord, now they're doing invite rewards. Amazing.</del><br>\n<del><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-11/1636641228-270476-image.png\" title=\"\"></del></p>\n\n<h3><strong>(11/11/21) Their hate against the <a href=\"https://drama.gg/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">drama.gg</a> community.</strong></h3>\n<p>First of all, this admin \"HasX\" apparently is starting a <em>petition</em> to <em>shut down</em> drama.gg which is just fucking brilliant.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-11/1636641472-362621-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nSame for the <strong>CEO</strong> (such a low hit) where he didn't even try that much to use grammar<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-11-11/1636641531-412523-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nOne of their worst admins even made a <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1198-dramagg-most-toxic-community/2\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">drama.gg thread</a> about how drama.gg is the most toxic community! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>\n\n<p>Now for the conclusion,</p>\n<h3><strong>Does it deserve the hate?</strong></h3>\n<ul><li>Yes, it completely does. You would NOT want to trust them with any of your personal information nor visit their websites. Not only do they log your IP address and possibly do malicious things with it, but they also require a full billing address just to signup as the owner said. This is not the host to go to or even consider.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading and have a lovely day!<br>\n-ItsTato<br>\nP. S.

Your friend System gave me the money and it would be up to HIM to ask for it. He has not asked for it and if he really wanted it right now, He would be asking me for it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&gt; he also abused hetzner to get a prepaid visa card off salad</strong><br>\nScreenshots are not valid proof of anything since inspect element exists. I did abuse hetzner once before but I have never \"Got a prepaid visa card off salad\" using it. I have not abused hetzner in multiple months and never plan on doing it again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&gt; as you clearly see he's raw admitting to abusing the company also he's not replying to me or my friend when we ask for a refund</strong><br>\nI was actually really busy with school the ONE time he asked. He has not asked me since then.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&gt; as he's not replying to my friend he asked me to try get in contact with him and when i got in contact with him (he gave the money back at the end but he would not talk and keep lying)</strong><br>\nI have given the money back so I really do not see the point in this thread.</p> \n\n<p><strong>&gt; so if he gave you money to a product for something he owns he should have access to it correct?</strong><br>\nIncorrect. Your friend gave me the 20 euro to purchase a Ryzen 5 dedicated server from Hetzner. I did purchase it and I have proof of purchase (If you need it, DM me Dubs#0001). I don't give people access to my nodes for security reasons since I don't fully know your friend and don't 100% trust him at the time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&gt; towards him its not which i find stupid. hes known for abusing people dont trust him also theres a video on him<br>\nwhich is exposing him</strong><br>\nThe video \"CodesterDubs Exposed - by JustCallMeTucker\" is old. Most of it is false and the only true part of the video is me \"Disrespecting Staff Members\". If you knew the full backstory and what happened before that in the video then you would most likely act the exact same way.</p>\n\n<p>I also noticed that you are going to be making a video about me and I would love to see it. Make sure to dm it to me when u post it ðŸ˜ƒ</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3518"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1143"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3518"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"32115"},{"type":"posts","id":"32665"},{"type":"posts","id":"32708"},{"type":"posts","id":"33209"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3518","attributes":{"username":"Dubs","displayName":"Dubs","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/cnGuHezum5BxvBYI.png","slug":"Dubs","joinTime":"2021-05-05T21:54:19+00:00","discussionCount":10,"commentCount":160,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-04-23T11:55:58+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4388","attributes":{"username":"Gunner","displayName":"Gunner","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/0VDi1q8Ym2B9E6VP.png","slug":"Gunner"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1143","attributes":{"title":"Holonodes/mcworld owner","slug":"1143-holonodesmcworld-owner","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"32115","attributes":{"number":6,"createdAt":"2021-10-25T21:49:10+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1143/5\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"32114\">Dubs</a> I would also like to add that I dont see how this is linked to \"MCWorld Hosting\"</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3518"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1143"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"32665","attributes":{"number":8,"createdAt":"2021-10-26T10:25:12+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1143/5\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"32114\">Dubs</a> he has lol <br>\ni got proof <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-26/1635243909-935924-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4388"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1143"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"32708","attributes":{"number":17,"createdAt":"2021-10-26T13:47:42+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1143/5\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"32114\">Dubs</a> want even more proof<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-26/1635256060-24618-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4388"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1143"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"33209","attributes":{"number":113,"createdAt":"2021-10-27T17:08:05+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1143/5\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"32114\">Dubs</a>  +353 83 393 4331</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4388"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1143"}}}}]}

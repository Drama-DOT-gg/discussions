After purchasing a service, the owner of the service mocked my situation by refusing to provide a corresponding refund. I was offered a free product that did not work and upon requesting a refund through the same payment method, the seller in question simply laughed at my request. In summary, I do not recommend trusting this hosting provider.</p>\n\n<p>Screenshots for testing purposes here:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-16/1676569282-149728-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-16/1676569301-712531-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-16/1676569316-158408-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>And to top it off, they haven't purchased a WHMCS license, which means their WHMCS is pirated.<br>\nEvidence of this here:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-16/1676569583-496813-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>And to top it off, they don't have terms and conditions or a privacy policy.</p>\n\n<p>I am posting this thread so that nobody falls for this scam.

You reply to threads so quickly unless u sleeping. Get a life and let other's get too. You have no job and your life is a joke dosen't mean others are same too. You are acting so unmatured here 90% of you replies makes no sense or makes a bit sense.<br>\nYou make homophobic jokes too so can I say that you are discriminative towards LGBTQ? Well I do make sometimes joke on that too. All i wanted to say is Everyone's pov is not the same. And assuming something without thinking what others think is just shit.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2801"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2801","attributes":{"username":"DeadBush","displayName":"DeadBush","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/XbjcjyJPwRXjAX5J.png","slug":"DeadBush","joinTime":"2020-09-13T20:26:47+00:00","discussionCount":16,"commentCount":295,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-10-07T06:26:03+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"I'm DeadBush","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"34","attributes":{"title":"Lamaker/ItzAwesome/Lily/Pamar | FalixNodes/Falix.gg & PrimeSRV","slug":"34-lamakeritzawesomelilypamar-falixnodesfalixgg-primesrv","isApproved":true}}]}

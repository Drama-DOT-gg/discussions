Later on, I found out they're using AWS for both of their nodes:<br>\nIN1:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-03/1646328619-775454-imagen.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nIn2:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-03/1646328670-912736-imagen.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>They also use AWS nodes for everything, including panel, dashboard and such.<br>\nThey're also using a Freenom Domain, <a href=\"https://tabhost.ml\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://tabhost.ml</a> . Here are their links:<br>\nDash: <a href=\"https://client.tabhost.ml/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://client.tabhost.ml/</a><br>\nPanel: <a href=\"https://panel.tabhost.ml/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://panel.tabhost.ml/</a><br>\nDiscord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/WUYquNa4\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.gg/WUYquNa4</a></p>\n\n<p>I know their ToS and Privacy Policy is in the works because if you go to #information on their discord, you'll see it says soon. They don't even have a site yet and they're already operating illegally. They also do random wipes which make me believe it's when their trial ends and they have to create another node?</p>\n\n<p>I sadly couldn't create a server to check what egg they were using, as their nodes were full already, and if it was a multi-egg to blacklist them, but I've created a ticket some hours ago to ask for invoices whatsoever they didn't reply yet. I'll keep you all updated.</p>\n\n","editedAt":"2022-03-03T17:37:28+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3427"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3427"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1770"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3427","attributes":{"username":"babyharpseal","displayName":"babyharpseal","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/gIjyTXWXF9yBA4uq.png","slug":"babyharpseal","joinTime":"2021-04-21T14:45:49+00:00","discussionCount":6,"commentCount":77,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-03-11T11:22:59+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1770","attributes":{"title":"TabHost | Freenom Domain | No legal documents and operating | AWS","slug":"1770-tabhost-freenom-domain-no-legal-documents-and-operating-aws","isApproved":true}}]}

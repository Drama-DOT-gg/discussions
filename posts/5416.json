Does it affect anything? No, it is too small community of exposers to share the truthfully (there even was a lot of cases when lies was posted in here), like what's point of this? I was happy to be part of winterhoax to expose few hosts however it's my time when I leave this shit place. I won't lie about PART of thread is truth, however not everything of it is, but I do not care, people have choice between trusting me or this thread. So cya - this is my last message in here, if anyone gonna try to winterhoax me, I won't even probably notice that or even care about it. This place became that shit, there is no point of being here.</p>\n\n<p>Now cya, you can try to dm me about winterhoax or spam winterhoax links in FalixNodes, however you will either be blocked or muted.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"16"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"5417"},{"type":"posts","id":"5425"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"16","attributes":{"username":"Pamar","displayName":"Pamar","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/lr35CsrQrf1b4wyG.png","slug":"Pamar","joinTime":"2020-07-15T16:35:03+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":140,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-12-01T21:20:30+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Catching bad hostings","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"34","attributes":{"title":"Lamaker/ItzAwesome/Lily/Pamar | FalixNodes/Falix.gg & PrimeSRV","slug":"34-lamakeritzawesomelilypamar-falixnodesfalixgg-primesrv","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"5417","attributes":{"number":256,"createdAt":"2021-01-28T18:42:28+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/34/255\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"5416\">Pamar</a> X2 ^^</p>"},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"5425","attributes":{"number":257,"createdAt":"2021-01-29T08:06:13+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/34/255\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"5416\">Pamar</a> Cry about it in ur private school :)) (If any of ur friends care (if you have any friends)).

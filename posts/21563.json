I did it because as I stated, I felt he was a bad person because he:</p> \n\n<ul><li>fails to take accountability</li>\n<li>brings up stuff that already is disputed (or we've disputed)</li>\n<li>gets angry at us, when it's his fault</li>\n<li>gets angry at us, if we win / say these reasons at his, and block him, he says it's out fault, bla bla, he just doesn't even wanna lose a debate, but he has already lost.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Now even because of this, it was still a bit childish. However, the video is still up, and been recorded, and logged, people have already watched it, so taking down the video won't do anything.</p>\n\n<p>I understand I may have been childish, and also mostly childish exposing him after we broke friendship, I understand I have also been childish during the dispute about him insulting religion, (mostly at the end, and sometimes) and me after breaking our friendship publicly (he unfriended me, and turned his dms off). (Yeah, there could've been a better way of doing it)</p>\n\n<p>I wish I can change some stuff in the past but I just can't. I'm sorry to anyone I've been a pain to. I will try to improve.</p>\n\n<p>Glowing Wishes</p>","editedAt":"2021-07-15T07:06:40+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3995"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3995"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"363"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"21570"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3995","attributes":{"username":"Somewhat","displayName":"Somewhat","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/H56i3c2jDZifWJVv.png","slug":"Somewhat","joinTime":"2021-07-15T06:30:09+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":76,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-07-29T21:08:34+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"363","attributes":{"title":"RedKn1ghtâ„¢ #0001","slug":"363-redkn1ght-0001","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"21570","attributes":{"number":65,"createdAt":"2021-07-15T07:24:38+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/363/64\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"21563\">Somewhat</a> <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626333866-167340-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe's crying so badly LMFAO-</p>"},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"363"}}}}]}

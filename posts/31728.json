By the time of being silent, I also waiting for you SLA and lawsuit to Abdullah (although it seems invalid now). Watching how Dashactyl's staff destroying other people VPS at support channel, the staff didn't get demoted and blame over the user fault for taking the advice given by staff seriously. Sometimes I am impress by your management skill, wonder is colournodes.com is also a mess.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I heard you tested positive, didn't wanna laugh at you but take care. I will go back to the topic and sum things up.</p>","editedAt":"2021-10-20T11:37:51+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3859"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3859"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"985"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"31729"},{"type":"posts","id":"31735"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3859","attributes":{"username":"Jerome","displayName":"Jerome","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/umHCxS4MxN79EUzf.png","slug":"Jerome","joinTime":"2021-06-26T04:58:43+00:00","discussionCount":11,"commentCount":163,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-04-10T07:50:38+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"985","attributes":{"title":"Jerome | Causing unnecessary drama in drama.gg.","slug":"985-jerome-causing-unnecessary-drama-in-dramagg","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"31729","attributes":{"number":32,"createdAt":"2021-10-20T11:31:07+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/985/31\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"31728\">Jerome</a> finally jerome responds</p>\n"},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"985"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"31735","attributes":{"number":34,"createdAt":"2021-10-20T12:10:02+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/985/31\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"31728\">Jerome</a> It has been over a month, is it up yet?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Wow you are sad.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/985/31\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"31728\">Jerome</a> Nah, you know what I meant.

He lied about \"I wanted to say in the thread that im gonna help you fix stuff, and that admins can close the thread but ok never mind\". He tried so hard. He even asked for Panel access because he wanted to \"help me\". Rum is pretty rude, I worked with him on my older hosting, I made a guy owner because He was willing to run the host. Rum was so rude that the guy voted to kick him out. He was kicked out of the staff team x3 and when we were planning to buy nodes, he would make jokes about us buying the nodes. We had our nodes getting delayed, he made so much fun of the idea that we're getting nodes. No one in my older server liked him because of his rude and aggressive behavior. I had a fight with my friend <em>ThunderX</em> and he was supporting ThunderX and I had a fight with him aswell, The reason I got rude with him in the first place was because we had a fight and I had hatred for him because he chose Thunder. Me and thunder got back to being friends and I made him the owner of OTAHosting but Rum couldn't stand it, so he decided to make a Drama.gg post so Thunder would eventually leave me because of the thread. I just don't like the idea of this guy being so jealous. He would always flex in my older hosting on how much he got, how much nodes he had and how much developed his host was. I don't believe this kid tries to be innocent by not telling the true story, If you want to come on Drama.gg, please tell your own past with me to others.</p> \n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3731"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"578"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"17303"},{"type":"posts","id":"17305"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3731","attributes":{"username":"ShamsPlays","displayName":"ShamsPlays","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/ROn0aZ8RF7gB3kby.png","slug":"ShamsPlays","joinTime":"2021-05-28T20:59:20+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":115,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-08-19T00:09:10+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3257","attributes":{"username":"RumGuru","displayName":"RumGuru","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/LfdbF5Ex7oM05L6h.png","slug":"RumGuru"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"578","attributes":{"title":"OTA - Hosting - ShamsPlays#2200/no tos&pp/lying about nodes/free domain.","slug":"578-ota-hosting-shamsplays2200no-tospplying-about-nodesfree-domain","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"17303","attributes":{"number":65,"createdAt":"2021-05-29T20:46:33+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/578/62\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"17300\">ShamsPlays</a> hahaha i never said i have million nodes i had like 1 node on my host and i didnt even opwn that host.<br>\nI started to make drama.gg thread even before ik thunder became owner</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3257"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"578"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"17305","attributes":{"number":66,"createdAt":"2021-05-29T20:47:55+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/578/62\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"17300\">ShamsPlays</a> do you have proof that i was rude to you, no you dont, you were actually rude to me and you were toxic.<br>\nYou demoted me from old host and later thunder invited me back.....</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3257"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"578"}}}}]}

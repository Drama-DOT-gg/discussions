Anyone could just fucking yoink the name and it's as good as gone.  All the information that was worked with via the panel was either public information or similar in information you could get from GitHub.<br>\n   \" I contacted them threatening to head to the cyber police, this was my largest source of information.\" &lt;- The \"cyber police\" don't get involved in petty shit like this and you of all people should know this. <br>\n   The information Skittle122 used to gather the mongoDB login should be shit that's locked so nobody can willy nilly go into it and give unlimited servers out. That should be a Owner privledge. Along with the roles in EpikHost being absolute fucked beyond belief and nobody seems to care to repare them. Skittle122 may have violated the privacy policy but the thing is you have no legal standing on EpikHost as a company thus this privacy policy is B.S. and void in the court of law.<br>\n\n   <ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\" start=\"2\"><li>Everyone in that entire group chat played a part in this whole shit show. Nobody was innocent and saying all the blame to be on Skittle122 is a load of horse shit. One man does not simply put together a whole nuke/token leak/mongoDB leak. <br>\n\n     <ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\" start=\"3\"><li>Skittle122 was NOT salty SpaceDoggo got a role. Skittle122 was salty BECAUSE he got a role without doing much as a mod and barely did anything when first promoted because of the perms in the discord server being dogshit and being fucked. It also felt like a stab in the back to the mods who did more then him. I for one feel the same way Skittle122 does. Being head mod and being active 24/7 yet SpaceDoggo goes directly from mod to Co-Owner in a matter of days. Not to mention 90% of the current staff team after the bans handed out by Rin for these actions on this thread, are all underage. Prime example is:<br>\n        <img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/911828168577531954/940593625786617886/IMG_20220208_183302.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n   Including the owner himself. Another thing is the second owner, GoldLion, who has been MIA with Covid for a while now, has been shat on by Rin himself multiple times. Even going as far as not caring if he dies in the ICU. Also in which he claimed ownership if Gold does not return.<br>\n   Flashbang warning<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/911828168577531954/944260542590230558/Screenshot_2022-02-18-21-24-08-86.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>\n\n\n    <br>\n    <br>","editedAt":"2022-08-13T09:39:41+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5601"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"41"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1718"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"5618"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"44328"},{"type":"posts","id":"44331"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"5601","attributes":{"username":"dabmaster41","displayName":"dabmaster41","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/wujxoCcS1wwllqPo.png","slug":"dabmaster41","joinTime":"2022-02-18T15:23:25+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":3,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-03-03T22:21:21+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"41","attributes":{"username":"Robert","displayName":"Robert","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/y24i4SFwKYCqRsxU.png","slug":"Robert"}},{"type":"users","id":"5618","attributes":{"username":"Skittle_Skittle1","displayName":"Skittle_Skittle1","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Skittle_Skittle1"}},{"type":"users","id":"4437","attributes":{"username":"MrRin","displayName":"MrRin","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Toh4F62Jnu6FbJPE.png","slug":"MrRin"}},{"type":"users","id":"5597","attributes":{"username":"SpaceDoggo","displayName":"SpaceDoggo","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/rXrvunrddQcr9F7X.png","slug":"SpaceDoggo"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1718","attributes":{"title":"Skittle122, Extremely salty ex-staff member making illegal threats.","slug":"1718-skittle122-extremely-salty-ex-staff-member-making-illegal-threats","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"44328","attributes":{"number":21,"createdAt":"2022-02-18T16:22:59+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1718/20\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"44327\">dabmaster41</a> <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/911828168577531954/944260542590230558/Screenshot_2022-02-18-21-24-08-86.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/911828168577531954/944260542590230558/Screenshot_2022-02-18-21-24-08-86.png</a></p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Discussed this elsewhere, have reason to believe Goldlion was faking it to try get away from us.

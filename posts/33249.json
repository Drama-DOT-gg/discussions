I was a staff (I'm still in the server as a staff in an alt) and I found a ton of dirt on this host.</p>\n\n<p>To start, their CEO TTEG is a known scammer. I once bought one of his plans and was pernamently banned from the server! Absolute scams!</p>\n\n<p>Another look is him purchasing a new node of 40$, he says he's bankrupt (Asia = bankrupt, he is in Asia and he's going all of Asia is bankrupt) so then you wonder how he is paying for these nodes? He is using stolen credit cards that he buys off eBay to buy this nodes and make a lot of profit from it.

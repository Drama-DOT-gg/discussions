I have spoken with our provider and he agrees it is a DDoS attack. You can also believe all you want that they are photoshopped images, he knows the screenshots are real and so do I. He is just butt hurt that I exposed his ass and so did trustpilot reviews. Also if you have \"tried\" my service and it is \"teribble\", why haven't you told us? You can't just say something is terrible, cry about it and then never tell someone so it can be fixed. Also if you look in the screenshots at the end of the post it shows Netstat and Nethogs logs to prove it is under attack.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/2\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25316\">CaveMan98765</a></p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"909"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"25447","attributes":{"number":119,"createdAt":"2021-08-22T18:24:40+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>i may have missed some stuff because this stupid drama.gg textbox is so small<br>\nI wrote more stuff about abdullah though, cuz it's about you anyways (I don't hate you abdullah, please don't hate me from this post I sent, this is just my personal comments and opinions)</p> \n\n<p>may have messed up some sentences and etc</p>\n\n<p>(first off, abdullah)</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I think he's a pretty cool guy, except I'm not surprised abdullah would actually be the one to ddos. DDoSing is a bad thing, and abdullah shouldn't do it. To be fair, a ton of people are on drama.gg has or can ddos, so most of you can really say anything about it. It seems like abdullah does have a rep for being a ddoser and immaturity as shown on the screenshots. I don't care if you ddosed or not, but please just don't do it next time.</p> \n\n<p>Second of all, the doxing threats are straight-up bad. Next time, you should check whoever you bought that logo from scammed you or not. If you want, you should report the logo designer for art theft.

I do take full responsibility for this. We did our best to restrict access and lock Yeetster and Voll out however I failed to take into consideration they had company code on their computer still which contained security keys. Sadly they did send me a list of the exposed data (Names and Emails) and I have full intention of taking action against them. As far as we're concerned we've completely locked them out and revoked all keys. I've already informed people of the breach and I've contacted affected persons privately and apologized.</p> \n\n<p>This is something I do not want to be able to happen at Galactiq and moving forward we're moving to far more drastic and secure methods of encrypting our keys and making sure that no one person can ever just have them which is what we should have done from the beginning.</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7096"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"49823"},{"type":"posts","id":"49829"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"7096","attributes":{"username":"Pengu","displayName":"Pengu","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/1eQRNFMALLaeH1YR.png","slug":"Pengu","joinTime":"2023-02-19T19:01:06+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":34,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-08-25T09:15:01+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"sqcJzkLHGyrR8o4G.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Owner of Galactiq","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"7097","attributes":{"username":"TravenGG","displayName":"TravenGG","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/4nBi3GqkULpSZZC5.png","slug":"TravenGG"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2115","attributes":{"title":"Galactiq - A facade of Fraud and Theft","slug":"2115-galactiq-a-facade-of-fraud-and-theft","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"49823","attributes":{"number":21,"createdAt":"2023-02-19T20:13:45+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2115/17\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"49819\">Pengu</a> you literally have no coding or cybersecurity skills to improve the security of your systems.

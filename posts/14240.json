Is a literal fucking fake, I don't know who in the right mind would believe that. Firstly, his name is striker, that's literally a normal name that an average discord user might use. Secondly, the court doesn't fucking say that they're here. They do private investigations, not make accounts called \"Striker\", and tell everyone that they're there. Secondly, Jack Knights is an actor, so the guy is possibly memeing. If he isn't, he claims to be on the rcj website. Which I can't seem to locate. So if you are trying to trick us, go fuck yourself and stop being the dumbest shit alive in 2021.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3384"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"122"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3384","attributes":{"username":"Prudentia","displayName":"Prudentia","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/qz6BnHtsfSxR4BKw.png","slug":"Prudentia","joinTime":"2021-04-13T23:32:01+00:00","discussionCount":6,"commentCount":94,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-06-15T00:11:57+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"HNIa5VbKlqOcBzBS.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"I'm a cool person #catgangforlife","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"122","attributes":{"title":"ViaHost, Sryden, ExoHost, AltHost, HelioNodes, BlockNode | Bad/Layer","slug":"122-viahost-sryden-exohost-althost-helionodes-blocknode-badlayer","isApproved":true}}]}

I have many questions about this thread. Plexed in fact, has absolutely nothing to do with mcworld. I am the owner of MCWorld and Plexed is not.</p>\n\n<p>I am aware of the unprofessional staff team we have at MCWorld and I will be working to get rid of a lot of them and bringing on many new ones.</p>\n\n<p>I have never encouraged or asked our staff members to review the hosting. In fact, I had encouraged them to not write a review about it. Nothing I can do about it if they do.</p> \n\n<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing invite rewards. It's a way of getting members and it works. It isn't against tos (that I know of) and it's just a easy way for our clients to get resources for their servers. It benefits us and our clients.</p>\n\n<p>Our \"shitass staff\" did not back him up. I typed \".-.\" because he has pinged twice. I was just trying to help a friend by posting his host in mine because mcworld has been down for some time because of some personal reasons with myself.</p>\n\n<p>Plexed may be carding.. I have no idea. I provide all the nodes for MCWorld and I pay for them all. (I can send proof when I'm on my computer).</p> \n\n<p>If you have any further questions please contact me on discord! <br>\nDubs#7708</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4996"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1265"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"36916"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4996","attributes":{"username":"Dubss","displayName":"Dubss","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/cQF43zc1D4HLRd5M.png","slug":"Dubss","joinTime":"2021-12-04T11:32:06+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":24,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-04-15T11:37:06+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4984","attributes":{"username":"A1ex","displayName":"A1ex","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"A1ex"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1265","attributes":{"title":"Plexed = Badsk = McWorld","slug":"1265-plexed-badsk-mcworld","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"36916","attributes":{"number":16,"createdAt":"2021-12-05T13:30:52+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1265/3\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"36851\">Dubss</a> Invite rewards are clearly against Discord's TOS.</p> \n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4984"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1265"}}}}]}

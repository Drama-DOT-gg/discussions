After I exposed him in his server I was banned. The scam worked by making members invite their friends, reaching a certain invite count, claiming your money and then recieving a screenshot saying it's been paid to your Paypal email. He would then say that the Payments take 2-3 days to arrive and give you vouch perms aswell as a claimed role. The payment would not arrive and if you did ask when it would arrive, you'd get banned. Along with another person <em>Reda</em> who scammed people with invite rewards like nitro, Robux, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Just thought I'd put this out there. There are probably many invite server's exactly like this one, however, the dudes that run this have a community reputation as they own a community server.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3533"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"459"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3533","attributes":{"username":"NightWished","displayName":"NightWished","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/QMP5kvMYGyyXcoUF.png","slug":"NightWished","joinTime":"2021-05-07T05:41:10+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":1,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-05-07T05:53:54+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"459","attributes":{"title":"Social404 is a scammer","slug":"459-social404-is-a-scammer","isApproved":true}}]}

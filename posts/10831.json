Let's call it a <strong>recapitulation</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So, We're starting with his first name. ItzAwesome. I know him from the time he had a free host with Nathan, in 2018 (I think). That free host was running on WHMCS and they were giving 2GB ram MC servers for free. Guess what... It failed in 2 days. And then he rebranded and changed his name, and here it comes. FalixNodes. In all of this. And it's started. ItzAwesome had no money, he had to find a way to get his nodes for FalixNodes, right? And he did! Everyone say welcome to IONOS! What's IONOS? The host's payment system which he abused!</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618301146-935039-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>It didn't take them too long to die and start having a data loss every one week. But wait, he needed to install his nodes somehow! So he finds a way! After getting money from donations, he bought Tommy's script from McMarket. Yeah, y'all know, the one he leaked, the same script which he edited and nuked his nodes under the name of <strong>IetCrift</strong>. And guess what, he got banned on mc-market for a little bit of time. He wanted to revamp FalixNodes, to make it \"Better than FreeMC\". Mario appeared. You don't know who's Mario? Mario is the guy that made the Dashboard! It went great for the first 2 weeks until they wanted to revamp again, and yah, you guessed. It got closed... It was so sad...(Sarcasm) But wait! After a little bit, it came back! It came back with new forces! There was a new stunning design, but still no money for nodes...<br>\nIt got closed after a few name changes and after another data loss.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618302821-184537-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618301839-415602-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618302762-978158-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618302780-740450-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>He even used this last image as proof of him really paying for the IONOS nodes.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>I mean, even one of his staff DMed me to come back...<br>\nAfter it got closed, he started wanting to get hired. He got hired, he gave their FalixNodes's SRC and then he nuked one of them after his identity was found again, as him being ItzAwesome.</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618302929-71004-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618302933-602995-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618302938-17658-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>He had one more try after that with a host, the host was called PureRam. I did him a trashy logo for free because we were friends back then (I don't even know how). It got closed after a short time.<br>\nBut now, he got hired on FabitHost, with a new name \"Pamar\". He did the same things... He installed FalixNodes SRC, they even gave WISP for free for a short time. They were having success. Aaaaand, he got demoted. And here everything starts again. The new FalixNodes (the actual one). I joined in, to see what illegal thing is he doing now. After a bit, he needed help from me again. He said this<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618303792-58630-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nAnd I did. He added me in one group with his alt. I did him the logo and guess what. He blocked me from all of his accounts but not banned me on Falix.<br>\nAfter a bit, I've sent 2 photos with the same guy, and guess what... I GOT WARNED FOR GAY CONTENT!<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618303554-66981-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nThe guy was a bodybuilder, he even sells training plans... Such a homophobe. To escape that, he came out as bisexual, and he even included the pride into his logo... More time goes away, I keep helping people in FalixnNodes, started my own projects (Failed with all of them), and then I've got hired. I was almost the only one helping. Oliver, another staff member, abused, Pamar didn't give a fuck. I've had to make a whole propaganda so he could get fired. And he got, but not by Lamaker. By Cat, the only guy that gives a shit about this host. He even made a company for them, he made everything that Lamaker needed. And here we are. Lamaker is online dating and not giving a shit, the performance is trash, FalixNodes's database got leaked. People got spammed with porn emails and every email and IP of their users are now on the Internet. I'm tired of this shit. Even one of his staff members started complaining and making bad reviews. So here I am, working on my actual project, Unfolded Domains (A Minecraft server), and writing about this shit. The only hope we have right now is Cat. He is the only one that can save FalixNodes by firing Lamaker because he haves every permission on discord and he also owns the Company, and hire talented people, people which actually care.</p>\n\n\n<p>I mean, do I still have to say anything else? <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-13/1618306190-468696-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n","editedAt":"2021-04-13T19:59:02+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"2"},{"type":"users","id":"30"},{"type":"users","id":"38"},{"type":"users","id":"41"},{"type":"users","id":"2864"},{"type":"users","id":"3358"},{"type":"users","id":"3664"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"312"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"313"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"314"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"315"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"317"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"655"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"discussions","id":"34","attributes":{"title":"Lamaker/ItzAwesome/Lily/Pamar | FalixNodes/Falix.gg & PrimeSRV","slug":"34-lamakeritzawesomelilypamar-falixnodesfalixgg-primesrv","isApproved":true}},{"type":"users","id":"2","attributes":{"username":"Sloth","displayName":"Sloth","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/6BdW7QU4UtMZIKtd.png","slug":"Sloth"}},{"type":"users","id":"30","attributes":{"username":"Triassic","displayName":"Triassic","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/vpuY80JJaf7LHX7q.png","slug":"Triassic"}},{"type":"users","id":"38","attributes":{"username":"Hussjs","displayName":"Hussjs","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Hussjs"}},{"type":"users","id":"41","attributes":{"username":"Robert","displayName":"Robert","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/y24i4SFwKYCqRsxU.png","slug":"Robert"}},{"type":"users","id":"2864","attributes":{"username":"leastile","displayName":"leastile","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/hrZzqfDkPKOK6y0p.png","slug":"leastile"}},{"type":"users","id":"3358","attributes":{"username":"DeadBushMC","displayName":"DeadBushMC","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/aV3JbpZKF4QHB5wE.png","slug":"DeadBushMC"}},{"type":"users","id":"3664","attributes":{"username":"BaconHead","displayName":"BaconHead","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/bDhN9GgVvb5mWJdI.png","slug":"BaconHead"}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"312","attributes":{"userId":30,"postId":10831,"reactionId":15}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"313","attributes":{"userId":2,"postId":10831,"reactionId":15}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"314","attributes":{"userId":3358,"postId":10831,"reactionId":15}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"315","attributes":{"userId":41,"postId":10831,"reactionId":15}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"317","attributes":{"userId":2864,"postId":10831,"reactionId":15}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"655","attributes":{"userId":3664,"postId":10831,"reactionId":15}}]}

If your company collects or processes the data of EU citizens, you are required to comply with this regulation. Non-compliance can result in hefty fines of up to â‚¬20 million or four percent of annual revenues, whichever is higher.</p>\n\n<p>One of the key aims and requirements of the GDPR is to keep EU citizens informed of how businesses collect, use, share, secure and process their personal data.</p>\n\n<p>Under the GDPR, you are required to inform your customers about why you are processing their data and for how long will you store it.

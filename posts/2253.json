I’m also not 12 and the company isn’t registered yet and I wont falsely claim that, we also get our domains through a good domain service which can cost up to 60$ but its worth it, We are also fixing the staff team as they aren’t the best. We have good services but bad reputation due to some people. Ie the other owner he is 16 but sometimes he can act like a 14 year old, I am currently 17, turning 18 soon so please watch what you say. This server isn’t a scam nore do we mean to set a bad reputation of the company. Sorry for the issues we have caused - CEO of EliteHosting. Thanks for reading have a good day. If you have anything else to say please state it, also forgot to mention we have only been a thing for 3 days. Can you clam it down a bit.... You won’t do any better.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2828"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"93"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"2254"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2828","attributes":{"username":"CustomConfig","displayName":"CustomConfig","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/fClzS3ly9XXIHXn9.png","slug":"CustomConfig","joinTime":"2020-09-22T13:45:31+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":5,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2020-09-28T10:09:21+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"7","attributes":{"username":"Jedrik","displayName":"Jedrik","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/DQfRHtHKGcVT6AZv.png","slug":"Jedrik"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"93","attributes":{"title":"Yes Another 12 Year Old CEO ","slug":"93-yes-another-12-year-old-ceo","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"2254","attributes":{"number":29,"createdAt":"2020-09-23T00:14:39+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/93/28\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"2253\">CustomConfig</a> also forgot to mention we have only been a thing for 3 days</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>This has been a recurring occurrence, no matter how young your host is, you show unprofessionalism or signs of just being shit overall, it's all going south from there, there's no excuse.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"93"}}}}]}

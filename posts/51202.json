Yes, that's how Badsk, get's his domains.<br>\nPirating WHMCS is very common, and the same with movies, like why tf pay for Netlfix LMFAO.<br>\n(Not Saying I Pirate Movies.)</p>\n\n<p>That's all I wanted to talk about, cuz everything else is bullshit, like Dennis, doing a DDoS. <br>\nHe is too dumb to do that. (Sorry Dennis).</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Scriptz, you are not an official CEO:</p>\n<ul><li>You're too young</li>\n<li>Too Dumb</li>\n<li>Knows nothing abt business</li></ul>\n\n<p>My R48, Badsk, pluto, whatever.:</p>\n<ul><li>Man said he does not go to school.</li>\n<li>Probably why he does well with his abusing hosts and then goes downhill.</li>\n<li>I am similar to him in one way, PROJECTS. He can't keep a project.

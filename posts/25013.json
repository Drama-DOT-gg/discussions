Because of this, I don't accept VPS donations any more, hence why I purchased my own.<br>\nSwivro itself doesn't have too many funds, since it doesn't offer products itself that cost $$. This means I can't hire a crazy good 3rd party security company to audit the software, but I do the best I can to ensure it's secure, even when it's not my own software.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4223"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"899"}}}}]}

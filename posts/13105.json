They are a free hosting service provider.</p>\n\n<p>Their privacy policy and TOS links to <a href=\"https://sydscloud.com/tos\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">SydsClouds TOS</a>, they don't even link to a proper privacy policy, and the company they link to is not even owned by them. SydsCloud, as the name suggest is owned by Sydney, and she confirmed that they can not use her documents.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829004454422511617/838468509180231730/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829004454422511617/838468752685137977/Screenshot_322.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829004454422511617/838469128947892244/Screenshot_324.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>They also lie about their provider, they said that it was multi-able, but its a mix of OVH, Hetzner, wowrack, and maybe a few others. I did not check all of their nodes and shit, but thats what I got from the ones I checked. You can confirm it by creating a server on their <a href=\"https://dash.orbitnode.us\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">dashboard</a>, then getting the IP from the <a href=\"https://panel.orbithost.us\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">panel</a>, or simply looking up the IP of their websites.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/829004454422511617/838469677298614312/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I am sorry for any grammatical errors that may have occurred in this thread, English is not my first language so I apologize for it beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone would like to add on to this thread, please feel free to do so.

I just want to tell you guys that I just simply don't want to deal with drama anymore. I stopped making hosts and non-secure projects. Right now I am still thinking if it's worth starting an another host, but before I will make sure I have enough experience. I am not a bad person normally, but I don't really know why I went on the wrong way and did all these bad things to people that didn't deserve it. Starwatcher is gone (it has been discontinued and deleted) and I don't think it's worth it to keep it unless I learn code (and this can happen because I really want to learn code from now). Now before leaving, I want to clarify some things that <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/QuagmireToilet509\" class=\"UserMention\">@QuagmireToilet509</a> said in this thread.</p>\n\n<p>1.. It's true that I joined WinterHoax to defend Hosticy, and it's also true that I was immature and toxic.</p>\n\n<p>2.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>he made a thread exposing a scam website. The poorly made thread even contained a few links with proof, the only issue is that they were links for his own website, that couldâ€™ve possibly been an IP grabber.</p></div></blockquote>\n  \n  <p>It don't know if it was an IP grabber, I didn't make it and I had 0 intentions to even try to do that.<br>\n3.. It's my fault that I didn't properly secure Starwatcher. Anyone with no experience had access to the source code, and because the database URL wasn't stored securely in ENV, it was extremely easy to hack the bot's database. And even if the database was sold on the dark web, I don't think hackers can do anything with servers IDs.</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\" start=\"4\"><li>I created the account SVR account to expose a recent data leak.

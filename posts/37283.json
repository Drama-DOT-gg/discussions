A for the most part of my employment with Floofy Hosting.<br>\nI'm extremely sorry if its messy and heavy to read, its 11.30pm where I am now.<br>\nMy experience being staff at Floofy was not the greatest I'd say.<br>\nI've had my share of stupid moments, mess ups, and ignorance, to keep it fair.<br>\nFirstly they claim their support roles are paid roles, along with their developer role are paid.<br>\nHowever, throughout my time there, I made a grand total of 0 dollars and 0 cents, exception of them gifting me nitro classic once(worth like 5$.... and I was there for a few months). I had been \"terminated\" on false accusation grounds.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-08/1638977107-526789-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe never specifically mentioned what I had supposedly given this dude at all, and I presumed that a \"nope\" would suffice, lest he produced a specific log.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-08/1638977207-625956-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nThen I got this message, and I just said ok, considering that I had been paid air throughout my time there. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-08/1638978579-908578-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nIll just give one example of floofy's crap while I was working there , HAHAHAH imagine giving a client a refund even though he asked for it 4 TIMES.</p>\n\n<p>There was also this policy for staff at Floofy, of which I am not sure if it is still valid today.<br>\nBasically I get free Minecraft Servers. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-08/1638978920-74010-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nI had made myself a few, as there was no obvious limit besides \"dont overload the node!\"<br>\nI had also given a server under my friend's account, of which I took down upon request from Abdullah.<br>\nMy main server I had under their benefits for their employees had been joined by Abdullah, and he immediately started asking questions about who owns the server.... then proceeds to stop the server......? What......?<br>\nDo also note he had implied that I had done wrong by giving myself this server in spite of him clearly saying that I get free Minecraft servers as long as I'm with them.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-12-08/1638979007-794119-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n","editedAt":"2021-12-08T15:59:17+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5034"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5034"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1284"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"5034","attributes":{"username":"Venomixal","displayName":"Venomixal","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Venomixal","joinTime":"2021-12-08T14:48:10+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":10,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-05-11T02:56:54+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1284","attributes":{"title":"LONG Rant on floofy hostings unprofessionalism(text heavy)","slug":"1284-long-rant-on-floofy-hostings-unprofessionalismtext-heavy","isApproved":true}}]}

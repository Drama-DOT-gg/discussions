But I was wrong, I did not investigate as good as I needed to.</p>\n\n<p>I bought the first package of the reseller webhost, and billingfox pro. (4.50 euros)<br>\nAnd after 5 days of experience, the first incident happened, BillingFox crashed and it reseted all of the things from the website. I was ok with it, I put all the things back. but then guess what?</p>\n\n<p>My webhost keep crashing and I knew sh*t about the reselling features. I only did what flaticon recommended to me, but It keep crashing. I got dd0s attacks afterwards because I had reseller hosting from \"Thos Host\" and I was angry, but flaticon said that the firewall dropped the proxy who dd0sed my \"hosting service\" and then, I found out that FlatIcon moved to CWP. When I got used to CPanel, he moved to CWP ( Centos Web Panel ) and he said he would move to QWPanel, or what it's called ( his own panel ) aka CPanel remake v2.</p>\n\n<p>If you ask any questions, don't hesitate to reply to my comment.</p>\n\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3385"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"372"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3039"},{"type":"users","id":"3385"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"10899"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3385","attributes":{"username":"Pandq","displayName":"Pandq","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/tE4jmt5SIqwOW8Hb.png","slug":"Pandq","joinTime":"2021-04-14T10:03:39+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":10,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-06-29T19:40:43+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3039","attributes":{"username":"Abooz","displayName":"Abooz","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/wtHK77raTr0S24WV.png","slug":"Abooz"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"372","attributes":{"title":"ThosHost, ThosBank, BillingFox Bad/Illegal services & Cracked software","slug":"372-thoshost-thosbank-billingfox-badillegal-services-cracked-software","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"10899","attributes":{"number":7,"createdAt":"2021-04-14T10:16:37+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/372/6\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"10898\">Pandq</a> QWP? that will be cringe as he said he will store user passwords in a json.<br>\nyeah trash hosting bad cracked/stolen software and slow servers.

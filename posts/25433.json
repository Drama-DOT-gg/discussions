Your longest response from us was like 18 hours which is pretty decent all things considered, especially as you know that we don't make a single penny on the specific vps plan you ordered due to the high costs of servers.</p>\n\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2943"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"717"}}}}]}

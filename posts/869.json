I guess I'll start from when he was first trying to start a host</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597252870-621304-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597253024-494809-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>He has a heart condition, is on disability, and his thoughts are to start a host? What's up with that? Also doesn't \"care\" about what anyone thinks. He's also told that if he goes to a hospital, his customers will have no idea what is going to happen to him. He's told here to be transparent on his condition too, so customers will know. He does have a \"business partner\" though... more on that later.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597254030-409922-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>He claims his business is registered in California early on. However, later on, when people ask him, he's very evasive about it ... and it's also not registered in California. He claims he has an LLC, but he hasn't given a filing number, or a state to tie it to.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597254259-166179-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n... no response</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597254344-63273-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n... and no response again.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597254363-177399-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n... and again.</p>\n\n<p>Sketchy I guess, but not hard proof, but he's also refusing to give information on his registration.</p> \n\n<p>Let's move on to ddos protection then, shall we?</p>\n\n<p>So on his website, you're greeted with how you can <strong>Begin your journey with the most powerful Minecraft platform available</strong>... Not going to comment on that I guess, let's look at what he offers.<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597254776-875349-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\noh hey!, 20 gbps ddos protection.</p>\n\n<p>except... he uses hetzner and webNX, and not proxied...<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597255003-613345-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597255085-173885-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>There's nothing wrong with using these two companies, especially because they're very cheap. However, blatantly advertising something as a feature is just wrong. WebNX has absolutely zero ddos protection listed on their site, while hetzner doesn't gives numbers.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597254558-282219-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nIt seems like they're from experience on ddos attacks on their own machine. <br>\nSure ... A 20gbps attack exactly, on both his hetzner and webnx machines... does he think ddos protection just magically applies to all his machines or something?</p>\n\n<p>Back to that business partner of his I guess <br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597256192-830004-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nseems like he doesn't have one anymore I guess<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597256389-369561-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n... except he still does? It's a <strong>silent</strong> co-owner, lives on the other side of the united states, and isn't in his discord. I guess if tony has to go to the hopsital one day, and the nodes go down and support tickets aren't being answered in the discord, his silent co-owner will know about it. In all seriousness though, how does he expect us to believe this? He's also not at all transparent about his heart condition, and how he's \"dying\". Seems like there's a high chance of him just going up and vanishing.</p> \n\n<p>More unfounded accusations that I believe, but I have no proof of:</p>\n\n<p>Upvote botting: <br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597256668-723418-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nTony's response? <br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-12/1597256715-191079-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nSomeone posing as a customer a couple days after he starts his hosting company in order to get him banned? God people must really be out to get him. Strange how they aren't doing it to larger hosting companies like pebblehost...</p>\n\n<p>One last thing, his nodes are strangely empty, and very uneconomical to host</p>\n\n<p>His nodes have 64gb of RAM, and they're all running a 12 core CPU.</p> \n\n<p>If he wanted to fill that up, he'd have to start selling 4/5gb plans. Each machine costs $140 to host, from webNX. <br>\nThe most profit he can possibly make on the machine with his 6gb plans($16 a month) is going to be $160, which after taxes and fees + the offsite backups he has, means that he's running at a loss, even with the most amount of profit he'll be taking from each server.</p> \n\n<p>Not to mention that his servers are strangely empty ... there's 0.42% cpu usage on this node, and it's been running for fourteen weeks now.<br>\n<a href=\"https://status.phoenixnodes.com/report/uptime/028663e18418fd1edbecc3f3758c3289/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://status.phoenixnodes.com/report/uptime/028663e18418fd1edbecc3f3758c3289/</a><br>\n3.1% cpu usage on this node, and it's been running for 15 weeks now.<br>\n<a href=\"https://status.phoenixnodes.com/report/uptime/4262585e542e01e37fe57965f708ec33/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://status.phoenixnodes.com/report/uptime/4262585e542e01e37fe57965f708ec33/</a></p>\n\n<p>????????

After three days of being a investor on Raided Hosting helping out my friends. Then after ViaHost came alive and was dying a lot I came on their server and checked them out. They were absolutely  horrible, really i'm not joking - theres even a winterhoax thread about it. A few days later when SceuGe joined, everything started growing on Via because he was giving free VPSs (16GB ram). Then I was a developer + administrator of it just to help them out a bit and tell them what they are doing wrong. When I was a developer on Via I was developing some sites like the main page and trying to make a client panel, when we announced it to the whole server that we are going to use it on ScueGe's nodes to host it on, ScueGe'd was so bothered about it that he literally copy all the files and use it for Host Horizon then shutting down the VPSs and the host had to be shut down.</p>\n\n<p>At Horizon Hosting<br>\nHere we at, at Host Horizon. ScecuGe the main owner of Horizon seen my work on the other discord hosting guild, and wanted me to be staff. I did not want to participate with them as he didn't give me my files plus coding that I did on the other vpss for sites. After him keep saying for me to be a investor / executive, I said \"NO\" because since he is investing other hosts why not do it for yourself then??. It makes no sense at all. Why would he want me to invest his host that has a stolen src on their \"not ready site\". SceuGe said why do you not want to be part of the team.. I said it's because I do not trust you anymore. When I didn't want to be investing him and his host. A few days later, I had nothing to do except from maybe checking out some other hosts, and the only host I could check out was Horizon so I DM'd SecuGe'd again and said can I apply for the team this time? And he gave me the invite and gave me the roles (management and CFO &amp; COO) straight away?? Still again why would anyone do that. It had 50 members so I was like I think I could help this host out by designing the channels and creating more information about the host.</p>\n\n<p>Working at.. Host Horizon?<br>\nOkay yes, I still had nothing to do but the guy was pretty nice to me and I was the investor of their host.<br>\nI bought them a starter node (De1) which had 30GB of RAM from hetzner. His management team was very happy and the userbase was happy about it to - but the userbase didn't know about that it would be coming to a bad end. A few days later, just when I am offline - I've been pinged and notified to do many things that I didn't get paid for. They kept asking me to pay to daft (Co Owner of the host) when he said he is gonna pay me.</p>\n\n<p>Heres Daft trying to force me to invest him something: <a href=\"http://prntscr.com/v7c5l1\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">http://prntscr.com/v7c5l1</a><br>\nHere's Daft trying to force me to give him money for a promotion?? : <a href=\"http://prntscr.com/v7c7z0\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">http://prntscr.com/v7c7z0</a></p> \n\n<p>I also have been told to put the root password (ssh access) in the executive-only category section multiple times, so I did since I got it for the owners to invest. After me not noticing, they have figured out the password for my hetzner account. (the ssh password was the same as the hetzner cp acc). Guess what they did, shutting down the hetzner nodes and fake deleting the servers. Even though i didnt have access to the admin panel..

Well no i do not give free nodes lmao i only do that if you are my friend and really want me to do some exe stuffl ike coding site. well actually i still want all my code back. Oreo,BobKabab and other staff are going to work me and eraters - a new host if i do not get accepted again. I still dont know why I got blamed firstly.

When a toxic person can no longer control you, they try to control how others see you. Stay above it, and eventually, other people will see the truth and how toxic that person is, just like you did. Like Bad does.</p>\n\n<p>Always be good to everyone you meet. Blessings sometimes show up in unrecognizable disguises. Unlike throwing a feud.</p>\n\n<p>Life is way too short, so do something good with your lifeüíù</p> \n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"122"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"discussions","id":"122","attributes":{"title":"ViaHost, Sryden, ExoHost, AltHost, HelioNodes, BlockNode | Bad/Layer","slug":"122-viahost-sryden-exohost-althost-helionodes-blocknode-badlayer","isApproved":true}}]}

That doesn't even make sense, if you're talking about software we use they're all from our partners (Qualy's and Elastic) who are industry leaders.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Teleport is a service used to remotely manage isolated infrastructures using SSH over HTTPS and RBAC, we utilise this with all our clients to isolate and cluster internal environments. Once again, very much not a virus- in fact it's open source!</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We do indeed monitor 24/7, we have staff in the US and UK on network and security ops all the time, on top of this we work with Atlassian and Elastic (of which we are a platinum partner) to deliver in-depth analytics, machine learning, synthetics and security with the alerting to go alongside it.</p></li></ol>\n\n<p>So how about you stop with your bullshit, admit you fucked up because you don't know what you're doing and go back to crying in your corner, still waiting for your so called 'evidence'</p>\n\n<p>By the way I'm not talking on behalf of my company but I am very much going to defend it ðŸ˜Œ</p>\n\n<p>Fuck off back to the hole you came from.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3745"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"891"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3745","attributes":{"username":"BrendansAtWork","displayName":"BrendansAtWork","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/lI5oZqLlYljnneUl.png","slug":"BrendansAtWork","joinTime":"2021-05-30T19:44:10+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":54,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-10-10T12:47:55+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"tLcRDjrHIchvo8uQ.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Barista in the day, noc engineer at the night\nAll these mf 12 year old skids running hosting 'companies'\nWork email brendantdj@thatspretty.cool\nAny advice I give isn't on behalf of my company shithead","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"891","attributes":{"title":"hacked by it company people","slug":"891-hacked-by-it-company-people","isApproved":true}}]}

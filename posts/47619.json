Also, you are still dodging evidence. Let me just explain what you are doing</p>\n\n<p>First, you appeared in my DMs and I asked identify yourself, and your response was childish.<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652392278-368344-e601ddfd-cd94-4e40-b318-a1b578b47968.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Second, you sent a image saying that Luxxy got DMCA'd and eventually, you deleted it. But luckily I have a screenshot, because of this you may have deleted more messages.</p>\n\n<p>The message deletion:<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652392340-292039-d83aad8f-76cc-48f5-a708-c7cd538ec479.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The image deleted:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652392377-466955-b11d1c04-4ff6-4607-8a35-f932afb1b1a1.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Third, you tried to put a robot's name over Luxxy to cover his stealing. Also, how is H3NRY? <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652392413-666114-bfce0652-129e-48a0-8ad0-a92aba94cfee.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Fourth, deleted a post on drama.gg, more suspicious.<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652392461-852770-70778a89-9c3f-4c96-8fcc-4631ed116545.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Fifth, childish actions, making a FAQ saying Mastermined to shut his mouth and posting a copied source of Privacy Policy from ZoidCloud.<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652392527-661865-5d02173d-4986-4d2d-bdd7-f2834817ae8a.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-05-12/1652392527-725127-412f5b9e-b3e1-4685-89ba-e6aee0d77407.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>Also, the final, not getting Luxxy to talk here. Seems he is afraid of me and he accepts that.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6253"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1919"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"47620"},{"type":"posts","id":"47621"},{"type":"posts","id":"47622"},{"type":"posts","id":"47623"},{"type":"posts","id":"47626"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"6253","attributes":{"username":"Mastermined_","displayName":"Mastermined_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/4sAmmGjm6WQ9mknT.png","slug":"Mastermined_","joinTime":"2022-05-05T09:20:01+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":35,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-06-11T14:18:26+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"6256","attributes":{"username":"Innocent","displayName":"Innocent","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/SUhPi8sElKOGU9pm.png","slug":"Innocent"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1919","attributes":{"title":"Luxxy hosting ( free hosting ) - luxxy stealer","slug":"1919-luxxy-hosting-free-hosting-luxxy-stealer","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"47620","attributes":{"number":78,"createdAt":"2022-05-12T22:16:12+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1919/77\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"47619\">Mastermined_</a> Damn.

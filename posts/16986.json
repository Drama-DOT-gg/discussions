I'm on Falix From so long when it had like 500 members. It used to be really good but now since there are like 80k+ users. The nodes are not enough and they are just overloaded no matter how much ram or core you have will still lag if the node gets overloaded. Maybe sometimes when most of the server goes offline it may not lag but 90% of the time it does. Leave java server aside which uses a lot of resources even one of the lowest resources eater PocketMine-MP lags too. It's because of Overload in nodes cuz of over allocation. They just need more nodes.<br>\nAnd this is the truth</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2801"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"17069","attributes":{"number":1168,"createdAt":"2021-05-28T13:18:39+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/34/1124\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"16986\">Legendary</a> you stupid?, I know how to use falix i have been using it for a year, until I got my own servers irl, Quit sucking on Lamaker's dick, I also know how to use a host properly I would rather use quack or aternos instead of falix.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3721"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}}]}

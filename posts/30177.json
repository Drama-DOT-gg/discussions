If you don't know me you will know me in sometime! ðŸ™‚<br>\nSo, I want to talk about DaryNodes. A Hosting which is full of scammers.</p> \n\n<p>1) All you guys know if any hosting overload it's node then what will happen. Same here then have AMD RYZEN 7 1700X [BIDDING SERVER] from Hetzner[Auction]. They bought 64 GB Node and overloaded it to 131 GB Ram.<br>\nYou know what will happen if any hosting overload it's node double triple times.</p>\n\n<p>2) Storage Issues!<br>\n:- If you buy their 2 GB Ram Plan you will get only 1.72 GB and left ram they won't give you. Same with Storage if you buy 8 GB storage which is with 2 GB Ram plan, you will get only 7 GB Storage. So, If all are paying full money so why they are cutting ram and storage.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-05/1633447581-416624-1.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>3) Storage Mega Issue 2.0<br>\n:- If you are buying 16 GB Ram you will get enough CPU but on the other hand you won't get Storage. No one can survive in 40 GB SSD only and who will survive in Overloaded Ram and Storage. Youtubers can't survive.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-05/1633447865-297646-screenshot-29.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>4) Lots of Grammar Mistakes in Website<br>\nThey even don't know english how to make website. They are using Template called \"Flex Start!\". Also they wrote free plans panel but where it is. I know it is closed but they don't have time to update website.</p>\n\n<p>By above conversation it is that DaryNodes is completely Scammer!<br>\nAlso, They don't have their backup systems. In case Hosting deletes our server data then they can't give it back.<br>\nThey also robbing paid plugins from their server users.</p>\n\n<p>Their Fucking Privacy Policy is \"DARYNODES have rights to erase anyone's data<br>\n without any information!\"</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4582"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1069"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"30178"},{"type":"posts","id":"30468"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4582","attributes":{"username":"AkshaySharma","displayName":"AkshaySharma","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/0KobRgP6TwB162Rz.png","slug":"AkshaySharma","joinTime":"2021-10-05T15:17:10+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":43,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-12-18T05:54:57+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4014","attributes":{"username":"Kowone","displayName":"Kowone","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/PSyaxpILQs0pvEBS.png","slug":"Kowone"}},{"type":"users","id":"4580","attributes":{"username":"Kiku","displayName":"Kiku","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Kiku"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1069","attributes":{"title":"SCAMMER COMPANY DARYNODES","slug":"1069-scammer-company-darynodes","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"30178","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-10-05T15:47:05+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1069/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"30177\">AkshaySharma</a> If all are paying full money so why they are cutting ram and storage.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>they're not cutting resources, it's just how pterodactyl think it is, for example, the host allocates 1000MB, of course pterodactyl won't think it is actually 1GB.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4014"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1069"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"30468","attributes":{"number":11,"createdAt":"2021-10-08T01:14:27+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1069/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"30177\">AkshaySharma</a> my dear friend i think u have degein thr website for me. if u are thinking Grammer mistake then u should pay attention in ur english class nothing else and qe are ensure about node health and we are carefull towards that. and That cpu is Only using 30% after so much load. and did u get any performance issue may i know let the node to be allocate 400gb ram.  thr Cpu is Amd Ryzen Pro 7 something like that and daily we monitoring the performance. and join English class pls.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4580"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1069"}}}}]}

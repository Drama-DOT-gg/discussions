I'm sorry, but like that's the exact definition of using paypal and being underage, anyhow, let's go back to where you said they were verified, a winterhoax moderator confirms that your paypal in not verified, please explain- oh wait you didn't want to respond due to you being unable to do so, bet you'll even tell me to stfu or even ignore this, which is fair, however, notice that if you're going in a legal court, you'll lose.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-03-01/1614633717-848502-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<em>(image from: <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/221-sparked-host/12\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://drama.gg/d/221-sparked-host/12</a>)</em></p>\n\n<p>Now if you don't mind, kindly go back to studying, go back to reviewing how legal things work, be more mature, answer every possible question, then afterwards think if you wish to publish stuff like those, I don't want you to make people believe Sparked Host LLC is a \"bad\" company or an \"illegal\" company while you're illegally having a paypal and lied that it's verified &amp; ignored the case.</p>\n\n<p>For the rest, I'd like you to take notes, it's not something to ignore but something to learn from, I've made mistakes in the past, and now, fixing them is the solution for those.</p>\n\n<p>Also Jen, about your question what they can do now, they can take the domain if they contact your domain provider, legally they are required to give the domain, I believe they've done this to many domains in the past, so like hatred said, \"For your own sake, I hope you take the deal they offered\", that's again, the best answer you could get and you should be thankful to hatred.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy,<br>\nAnthony M.</p> ","editedAt":"2022-05-26T15:48:05+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3168"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"41"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"221"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"7615"},{"type":"posts","id":"7616"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3168","attributes":{"username":"AnthonyM","displayName":"AnthonyM","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/U5y7ReYc42jibz2q.png","slug":"AnthonyM","joinTime":"2021-03-01T21:03:39+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":9,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-03-01T23:33:33+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"41","attributes":{"username":"Robert","displayName":"Robert","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/y24i4SFwKYCqRsxU.png","slug":"Robert"}},{"type":"users","id":"63","attributes":{"username":"Jen","displayName":"Jen","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/nEonNSnQZxgu2J1i.png","slug":"Jen"}},{"type":"users","id":"56","attributes":{"username":"Iceey","displayName":"Iceey","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/A21zcRFQYnZkfY0E.png","slug":"Iceey"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"221","attributes":{"title":"Sparked Host","slug":"221-sparked-host","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"7615","attributes":{"number":20,"createdAt":"2021-03-01T21:44:38+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/221/19\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"7614\">AnthonyM</a> lmfao the funny part is<br>\nSparkedHost doesn't have a trademark they only have an LLC<br>\nMy Lawyer even did some digging and an LLC can't be used as a trademark<br>\nThey have 0 trademark registered any place in the fucking world</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"63"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"221"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"7616","attributes":{"number":21,"createdAt":"2021-03-01T21:48:00+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/221/19\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"7614\">AnthonyM</a> You realize Sparked Host LLC illicitly voided the Copyright and Trademark Notices of the Terms of Service by falsely claiming trademark registration?

This means that legally, individuals below the age of 18 cannot register a company on their own. They do not have the capacity to enter into legally binding contracts or fulfill the obligations that come with running a company.</p>\n\n<p>However, if someone below the age of 18 is interested in starting a business, they may explore alternative options. One possibility is to involve their parents or legal guardians in the process. Parents or guardians can register the company on behalf of the minor and assume responsibility for its operations until the individual reaches the age of 18.</p>\n\n<p>Please do your own research before trying to slander someones name,<br>\n<code>be better</code></p>\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7211"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2162"}}}}]}

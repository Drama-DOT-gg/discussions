The owner acts like he is 9 years old. Bans people for such a weird reason. K ill explain stuff now.<br>\nFirst I was begged to join in dm by one of their owners.<br>\nThey believing on fake news which is really old anyway, He didn't listen to me when I try to tell him it's fake and stuff and in return, he replied he is a hacker and he used to ruin peoples lives and when I asked what language is used in hacking his answer was coding. Even a child knows that coding is used but he doesn't know what language lmao XD. <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cx2vWJD.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\">  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nRa5f80.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"> he said he made a game using unreal engine and I asked what language this is what happened <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4o9Z8Vl.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"> .</p>\n\n<p>Their server is super laggy even on 2 players. And the owner bans people for critising. A guy said the server is shit and he was banned and how is that a reason to ban someone. <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yXWnZEo.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"> . When I asked how is that a reason to ban then they immideatly made a new rule <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xpnOVcH.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"> .  That a shitty rules the owner completly took rights to critise from his players. <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yEOh1Qw.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"> .  And later since I started to expose them they unbanned the guy and he was made to say thier server is the best server when that's the most shittiest server I've ever seen <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BGphkj5.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Go to their discord server and critise them then you will get banned lmao. I got banned too <a href=\"https://discord.gg/vNJSmNSNr4\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.gg/vNJSmNSNr4</a></p>","editedAt":"2021-04-09T11:09:03+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3358"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3358"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"359"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"285"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3358","attributes":{"username":"DeadBushMC","displayName":"DeadBushMC","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/aV3JbpZKF4QHB5wE.png","slug":"DeadBushMC","joinTime":"2021-04-09T04:12:20+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":61,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-07-11T10:06:20+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"359","attributes":{"title":"Scuffed MC server and Owner.

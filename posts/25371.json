DDoSing is a bad thing, and abdullah shouldn't do it. To be fair, a ton of people are on drama.gg has or can ddos, so most of you can really say anything about it. It seems like abdullah does have a rep for being a ddoser and immaturity as shown on the screenshots. I don't care if you ddosed or not, but please just don't do it next time.</p> \n\n<p>Second of all, the doxing threats are straight-up bad. Next time, you should check whoever you bought that logo from scammed you or not. If you want, you should report the logo designer for art theft.

Your thread was locked 3 times by Robert who (if you examine the screenshots) apparently thinks you're a joke. So you decided you were going to open a new thread after the one you had originally opened was locked. Desperate who?</p>\n\n<p>Two things you have failed to mention is that, believe it or not, you hit our panel with cURL. I am aware you are going to profusely deny this although we have substantial evidence pointing the DDoS attack directly to you which is shown in the other thread. The other action in question is that you have made an illegal defamatory site claiming that Hostaris is.. well... see for yourselves: <a href=\"https://hostaris.app\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://hostaris.app</a></p>\n\n<p>Two more things you have, again, failed to mention, is that the screenshots in question were taken hugely out of context, and were all consensual at the time as we were firing insults back and forth between the group. The second is that in your previous thread (which was locked) the Companies House information was cleared up and we explained that: 1. The address on there is actually a well-known business &amp; personal mail redirection program - which is allowed on Companies House and over 8000 companies used this (KUBBUR Limited is one big mention); 2. My nationality was a mistake on their side, to which we have logged a request with them to rectify the situation; 3. We have also logged a request with them to correct the incorrectly keyed-in DoBs. We had no reason to put in a fake date of birth as Sam is over the age of 16 - which is the minimum age to open a company.</p>\n\n<p>To this date, you have never documented an actual SQLi vulnerability. You sent me one, but this was quickly debunked when we realized that if the user ID didn't exist (The user ID was the string that was being exploited), the vulnerable code <strong>wasn't even run in the first place</strong>. Regarding the other issues, I have explained to you multiple times that the issue is being worked on. I haven't even had access to the code until this morning.</p>\n\n<p>You are also definitely aware that the screenshots sent here were completely satire and we resolved this issue the other day. You had never told us you had a disliking toward the content we posted as you were firing back yourself. When you did tell us in fact, we agreed to stop the content and there was a slip-up by Samuel 2 hours later. This is human and mistakes can be made. You decided enough was enough and finished making your little website which was published at around 2 AM this morning.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Sam's ban from Drama - he was banned after the satirical joke of identifying as a \"DDR2 memory module\". Your claim for him to have attacked Drama.gg is entirely baseless and has no evidence.</p> \n\n<p>I trusted you and sent you private information about our client portal in the hopes that you would find and report vulnerabilities. You abused this privilege to attempt to destroy our livelihood. Never contact us again, you are an absolute disgrace. You ruined a long-term friendship because of your frankly immature, childish, and disgusting means and intentions. I also attempted to resolve this with you MULTIPLE times, to which you completely blew me off over your immaturity.</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677194088-614841-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677193962-344590-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677193776-916854-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nI tried to handle this like a man, and you completely blew it off.</p>\n\n<p>There will be no further correspondence.</p> \n\n<p>--<br>\nModerator's note: censored someone's name on their request</p>","editedAt":"2023-02-24T07:37:40+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"1768"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"41"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2119"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3456"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"50005"},{"type":"posts","id":"50007"},{"type":"posts","id":"50008"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"1768","attributes":{"username":"J0SH","displayName":"J0SH","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/9afJ85K2vKn5cwY7.png","slug":"J0SH","joinTime":"2020-08-31T00:21:07+00:00","discussionCount":8,"commentCount":368,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-07-26T16:05:46+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"41","attributes":{"username":"Robert","displayName":"Robert","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/y24i4SFwKYCqRsxU.png","slug":"Robert"}},{"type":"users","id":"3456","attributes":{"username":"samxd","displayName":"samxd","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/DN9JmlfzPUkAj29W.png","slug":"samxd"}},{"type":"users","id":"2951","attributes":{"username":"Chirag","displayName":"Chirag","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/EBu92nGgi2Y9tYOD.png","slug":"Chirag"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2119","attributes":{"title":"HostAris, OptikServers, CortexNodes, samm#9400 and J0SH#9586","slug":"2119-hostaris-optikservers-cortexnodes-samm9400-and-j0sh9586","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"50005","attributes":{"number":5,"createdAt":"2023-02-24T02:41:13+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2119/2\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"49993\">J0SH</a> 3rd ss ofc I wouldn't help you out if you're not even gonna bother fixing it<br>\n4th, but I didn't nuke optik, did I?

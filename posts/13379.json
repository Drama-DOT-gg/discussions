But dosen't mean other staff can warn or mute for reporting rule breaker and I clearly said excluding exo cuz he is innocent here. But I have been warned multiple times for reporting. I don't have a good memory (I had big accident once and it affected my brain) so my Memory power is low. I can't remember exactly the names but I have been warned 3-4 times for one ping</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2801"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}}]}

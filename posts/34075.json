I'm assuming the CEO was hoping I wouldn't see the ban message because ya know, I was banned. However mobile notifications are a beautiful thing.</p> \n\n<p>I'm going to go over my previous post again with some added information.</p>\n\n<p>**After joining their discord I immediately notice a few things:</p>\n\n<p>They are condoning the use of bots being used as users (against Discord's TOS)</p>\n\n<p>Staff were condoning dos attacks</p>\n\n<p>A low level staff member (one that should not have access to such things) leaked the password to their website node and their 2nd node (Never said what it was to, but still did it)</p>\n\n<p>They are letting users post their passwords in chat (this one is kind of on the user but should still be removed from their chats anyway)</p>\n\n<p>The password for the website node and node2 were the same, and after a quick google points toward a Lego replacement kit. (Might be a coincidence)</p>\n\n<p>After telling the owner about the passwords and access to the nodes (staff leak too) the owner claimed it wasn't a big deal and that node2 was only for honeypot (which is still a security concern)</p>\n\n<p>The owner also only agreed to add an egg to the panel that allowed the generation of income for clients if he was given 1% of the profits from anyone who used it via bitcoin</p>\n\n<p>Their TOS is also virtually non existent:</p>\n\n<p>_1. it is strictly prohibited for admins to look at your server unless you allow them to or unless they are asked to fix something.</p>\n\n<p>you cannot zipbomb/forkbomb/sudo rm -rf /* the container in which you are running the server, if you do that, that wont do anything to us but you will get instant ban.<br>\nalts are not allowed, if you are caught using them you will get the ban.<br>\nif you ddos or cause damage to any of your servers, your ip will be most likely publicly exposed.<br>\nby signing up to yeet hosting you confirm you are +13 or you have parental authorization for using our services.<br>\ncryptomining in any way is strictly disallowed even if its chia mining.<br>\nrefer to respective hetzner and digital ocean TOS to know more on what you cant do.<br>\nlinks:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/terms-of-service-agreement/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/terms-of-service-agreement/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.hetzner.com/rechtliches/root-server/_\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.hetzner.com/rechtliches/root-server/_</a></p>\n\n<p>Notice how 4 threatens to publicly expose your IP address instead of reporting it</p>\n\n<p>They also do not have a privacy policy at all</p>\n\n<p>You can check their site here to see if I missed anything - <a href=\"https://www.mindustry.me/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.mindustry.me/</a>**</p>\n\n<p>So yeah very interesting right?

Why do they like me? Why do I have partners and Investors, as well as access to more resources than you? If your going to attack my company you need client testimonies to prove it, you have provided no evidence to back any of your attacks or claims. I've used images to prove my points, and you've made claims. I have no intention of trying to shut you down, the point of this is to bring your attention to these issues you neglect. If your going to do hosting, do it right or not at all. I tried to help you and you decided to be rude, I never tried to buy you I tried to work with you.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4777"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1171"}}}}]}

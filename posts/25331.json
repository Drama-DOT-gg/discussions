Don't take people out of context, you have 5 threads on drama.gg about your company. It just shows how incredibly immature you are and how you can't move on.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding DDoS, I don't know if you know or not but there used to be someone named TBN, who happened to be my best friend. He quit DDoSing and stuff in May, I never DDoSed anyone myself, and I'm not DDoSing your company.</p>\n\n<p>About your logo, I actually paid someone $5 or $10 to make it, but I guess that's what you get for that price. He assured me the \"rights\" to it but oh well.</p>\n\n<p>And regarding the HetrixTools refresh rate, this is because HetrixTools \"heart rate monitor\" has serious bugs, and it's not advised to be used, but it's the only one that shows the CPU, RAM, storage usage. Setting the refresh rate to 5 minutes or above will fix the 99.x% uptime bug. I explained this to you but you decided to intentionally take me out of context, just like a lot of other things here ðŸ™‚</p>\n\n<p>Also, the TrustPilot reviews have no evidence behind them, just feel free to ask any of them for evidence ðŸ™‚  They're just people who either got denied for staff applications (as I used to run that, and notify the applicant if he's either accepted or denied) or just people like you, who have never even tried the services but still find the audacity to leave 1-star reviews on other peoples' hard work.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that you're spending more time on \"exposing\" me and less time working on your broken company just shows why it hasn't taken off. You can probably fix the issue with your daemon in less than 30 minutes if you actually put in the times. ColourNodes is just a WinterHoax literally, and lies about legal registration, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that ColourNodes management is sitting on drama.gg all day instead of fixing their <strong>broken</strong> servers and setup should show you guys how good their services actually are, and how much they care about their customers.</p>\n\n<p>I am deleting my messages because I want to stop being taken out of context. And are we not going to talk about how you and your father <strong><em>genuinely</em></strong> tried to take me to court and get me arrested for firing you from my company? The constant threats I used to receive from both your father and yourself and accusations over things I never did?</p>\n\n<p>I think it's time that you grow up and start focusing on more important things, rather than things that have no value to you.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3662"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"909"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"25332"},{"type":"posts","id":"25334"},{"type":"posts","id":"25335"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3662","attributes":{"username":"abdullah","displayName":"abdullah","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/CeagHWLlW1guFVRp.png","slug":"abdullah","joinTime":"2021-05-19T20:01:20+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":32,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-09-11T22:28:29+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_"}},{"type":"users","id":"2951","attributes":{"username":"Chirag","displayName":"Chirag","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/EBu92nGgi2Y9tYOD.png","slug":"Chirag"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"909","attributes":{"title":"abdullah.#0001 | DDoSer | Threatening to DOX | Lots of downtime on company","slug":"909-abdullah0001-ddoser-threatening-to-dox-lots-of-downtime-on-company","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"25332","attributes":{"number":17,"createdAt":"2021-08-22T17:16:25+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/16\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25331\">abdullah</a> you have 5 threads on drama.gg about your company.

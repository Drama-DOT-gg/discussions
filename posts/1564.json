However imo this thread is just for you (as competitor) to take down or give bad reputation to other competitor so you could get more sales, You did not provided any screenshots about the WHMCS support chats (about it wasn't suppose to be an authorized domain or it's not actual key) and I am pretty sure Licenses2host is legit here in WHMCS side, you just incorrectly asked WHMCS for verification (ex. You used the license from Licenses2host which is INTERNAL LICENSE it must be used only in installation). So pointless drama and thread.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"16"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"74"}}}}]}

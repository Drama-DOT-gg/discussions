One of the employees of a company I'm working with reached out to their staff for help on an issue, and the staff member, <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Shershah\" class=\"UserMention\">@Shershah</a> took advantage of that user's lack of knowledge and tricked him into nuking the entire OS of a server buy running <code>rm -rf /* lulw</code> in base64. The staff member then went on to call the client an idiot, and told them that they shouldn't try working on a server if they don't know basic Linux, as if the client shouldn't have somewhere to start learning.

Me and my other mate, Aaron. We both got demoted even tho we were the only ones truly working and doing effort. This \"company\" forced us as staff to treat members who dont pay with no equality and in an unfair way. The community manager does NOTHING for the community. All of our suggestions are denied. All of the members' suggestions are denied too. They even told me after I asked to fix their crap server \"Listen, you do what we tell you to do or you get demoted. Consider your self an employee or even a <strong>slave</strong>\". This is really ridiculous and unbelievable. I'm soon going to be moving all of my bots hosted on there and leave their shitty server.

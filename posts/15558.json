He's been providing free hosting for users for a few years, is legit and is based only on donations. Kinda hurtful that he would claim those are his servers. You can check out the real images in #server-pics in discord.gg/dbh. He also posted a few videos. Any purchases he makes, he most of the time asks the comunity wether we want for example more storage or more ram. Overall a really friendly guy.  (Just thought I'd explain where those images originate from.)</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3838"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"520"}}}}]}

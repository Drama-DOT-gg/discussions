It's free and it does not have any fees except the PayPal fee. There's nothing wrong with it I mean just check it out on Github the entire code is available there. It's also custom made for Pterodactyl so that means less configuring than blesta or some other WHMC clone.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4322"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"999"}}}}]}

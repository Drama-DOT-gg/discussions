They also they agreed to cover 50% of the shipping cost as it was pretty expensive shipping from Canada to UK aswell also to pay the twise debit card fees (which was 10$) so we paid 390$ on April 4th, 2021.<br>\nNote: before paying for the colocation the administrator agreed to offer a refund within 31 days if we were not satisfied with the service also while covering the return shipping fee. Do note that at this point we never really got the server fully setup since we were waiting for parts and we had to refund an nvme riser due to it being broken, but after we got it all working it was a while later and that was not what I was looking for so I raised a refund request on the 1st of May and to date which is 18 June 2021 we have not received a refund yet. The administrator had never ending excuses for not being refunded and a few of them are as follows<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005765-49263-f4b64f82-c596-4bb0-8642-9df3e734ac7e.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005775-175223-2702b5ad-78c6-4ea2-bea4-52b45b0b4bc9.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005785-44843-b226be5c-5f83-42e7-a610-4e7116034e95.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005794-963418-b1884874-2de6-4b1f-ab4a-0a74bbf5b7de.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005804-165092-076640ff-889f-471c-9259-00fe2d7e8b8d.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005813-827477-9d0d0b56-f44c-431e-ac09-da18ee32e7d8.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005826-698582-573d47a7-716e-4bc0-bbd8-95337322a7f3.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005835-182604-786cc8a6-9b9d-47d9-8065-56aa9353a87b.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005846-468976-f2887c60-2ff8-4420-bba3-ccf1aba217f6.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005853-417845-ce02b268-abac-4d19-98b6-a8252e182295.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005860-216088-7586671a-36da-4bec-b4a6-53bb6f2c6576.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005871-822633-37b8c3e8-116e-490e-af57-0bf9b939d53f.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005882-933316-7bc16923-e72c-4285-b650-589e49c27126.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005893-88716-76227994-8044-4a42-926e-cf86f5b7a498.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005899-20228-18f563cc-3b10-4d5a-921d-aa36d0ed5421.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005904-760773-ef5c816f-18e4-4f7c-8336-b888fb795cfc.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>The second part to this is when me and eraters ordered a dedicated server from System 413 for $70/mo ($35 Setup fee). We didn’t receive the dedi even after a week which was past the timeframe that was given to us, so we again raised a refund request which they said was okay. From what eraters told me, they showed the proof that CPU was what was holding up the order along with proof of it. Then eraters said it was fine but then, as usual, we still receive it. We once again, we forwarded the refund request but they said they wont be refunding the setup fee which we said was fine even though we didn’t receive it in the first place. I would also like to add in 2 things, for both transactions (colocation and the dedi), I paid with transfer wise, and for the dedi payment, at first I was given a UK payment page which didn’t work as my card is a US card, so we moved on to transferwise, which we probably tried 3 or 4 of the administrator and System 413’s bank accounts to get the payment to go through.<br>\nI would show screenshots of this, however a lot of the chat has personal info in it.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005945-510757-262496f9-6d54-4890-b427-3ddf011260cc.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005953-95647-9856d7dd-b422-4a2f-8a1f-5d47eaa86e8b.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n","editedAt":"2021-12-31T17:23:34+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2804"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"717"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2804","attributes":{"username":"Plactrix","displayName":"Plactrix","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/5vJ1A6AEe37Ro8Pb.png","slug":"Plactrix","joinTime":"2020-09-14T23:43:07+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":31,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-10-27T05:37:49+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Sad","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2","attributes":{"username":"Sloth","displayName":"Sloth","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/6BdW7QU4UtMZIKtd.png","slug":"Sloth"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"717","attributes":{"title":"System413 - Waited over a month for a refund, never received.","slug":"717-system413-waited-over-a-month-for-a-refund-never-received","isApproved":true}}]}

Hardly any support is even given there. I also looked for support yesterday because the AFK page was broken on your product, and was met with crickets chirping.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is not how hard or easy it is to reset. The issue is your egregious arrogance and having led someone to <em>having</em> to reset it in the first place. He shouldn't have <em>had</em> to reset it because of your so-called \"support\". Don't take advantage of people's lack of knowledge for your own amusement. Instead, be a teacher and a leader.</p>\n\n<p>I also addressed the trial VPS in an earlier comment.</p>","editedAt":"2021-10-19T20:53:18+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4665"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4665"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"31697"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4665","attributes":{"username":"Music4lity","displayName":"Music4lity","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/VKNvXCX4nd5U1eBv.png","slug":"Music4lity","joinTime":"2021-10-19T13:43:16+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":40,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-10-20T14:50:16+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1118","attributes":{"title":"Dashactyl Support","slug":"1118-dashactyl-support","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"31697","attributes":{"number":167,"createdAt":"2021-10-19T20:49:41+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1118/164\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"31691\">Music4lity</a> and was met with crickets chirping.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If you are now gonna sit here complaining about <em>community support</em>, that is something new.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}}}}]}

The two ceos are をまDrqgonsまを<br>\n#0001 and CustomConfig<br>\n#5878. As I know, why would you run a host if you don't even know how to install the pterodactyl panel, setup eggs etc. One of their ceos were constantly dming me about an issue with their test server on their brand new panel that I've installed because they asked me to. <img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-09-30/1601476520-643797-screenshot.jpeg\" title=\"\"><br>\nOne of the ceos doesn't even know how to create servers on the pterodactyl panel. I believe that をまDrqgonsまを is under 13, the error is in the message it self. They should learn more about the pterodactyl panel before starting a host with it. Also, one of their ceo is constantly spamming me with pings about to add allocations. Just go learn to use the pterodactyl panel first.</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"39"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"93"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"39","attributes":{"username":"Withdrawal","displayName":"Withdrawal","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/wRzLphnBXFR4Yd2C.png","slug":"Withdrawal","joinTime":"2020-07-20T15:48:32+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":114,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-19T16:39:17+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"93","attributes":{"title":"Yes Another 12 Year Old CEO ","slug":"93-yes-another-12-year-old-ceo","isApproved":true}}]}

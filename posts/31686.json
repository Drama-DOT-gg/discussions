Hardly any support is even given there. I also looked for support yesterday because the AFK page was broken on your product, and was met with crickets chirping.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is not how hard or easy it is to reset. The issue is your egregious arrogance and having led someone to <em>having</em> to reset it in the first place. He shouldn't have <em>had</em> to reset it because of your so-called \"support\". Don't take advantage of people's lack of knowledge for your own amusement. Instead, be a teacher and a leader.</p>\n\n<p>I also addressed the trial VPS in an earlier comment.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4665"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}}}}]}

After this youtuber gave them a 0.3 starnode lost 80% of its users and thousands of reviews began to be published.  Now I want to tell you about the StarNode nodes, to begin with it goes without saying that they are Oracle free trials, every 30 days they turn off the nodes and change them saying that they are normal restarts, Mr. Vainki is a creepy person who abuses some free services to earn money.  Also, in his free time he is dedicated to screwing other people by throwing other people's nodes and erasing people's hard work.<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661535808-572035-image.png\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661535819-966466-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661535834-524150-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661535842-65617-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661535855-509412-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6765"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2018"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"48600"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"6765","attributes":{"username":"Pelotudo_","displayName":"Pelotudo_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/7NFdxhIdi8rZrgHr.png","slug":"Pelotudo_","joinTime":"2022-08-24T20:47:27+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":19,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-10-11T01:34:20+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"5755","attributes":{"username":"TheJulianJara","displayName":"TheJulianJara","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Pft6H1ORVMxZzzPc.png","slug":"TheJulianJara"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2018","attributes":{"title":"Starnode/Vainki The worst hosting and a horrible person","slug":"2018-starnodevainki-the-worst-hosting-and-a-horrible-person","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"48600","attributes":{"number":5,"createdAt":"2022-08-26T20:03:55+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2018/2\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"48592\">Pelotudo_</a></p> \n\n<p>I don't understand what I have to do with this topic, but since I've been included, I'm here to comment on one thing.</p> \n\n<p>To begin with, Vyxterhost and StarNode are friendly hosts.</p> \n\n<p>I don't understand what my comment on YouTube has to do with it, when all I did was to thank Abnej for his opinion for the host and take it as feedback.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I find it very hypocritical of you to accuse without any kind of proof, although I don't like to get into this kind of \"forums\", I come to show you one more proof that SharkHost uses free nodes from IONOS.</p>\n\n<p>A few days ago, I entered to SharkHost's Discord server and did a little research to see if they really use free IONOS nodes.</p>\n\n<p>What gave me the certainty that they do, was the following:</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the CEO of SharkHost, had managed to get the free nodes and started again his scam towards the users.</p>\n\n<p>Message of 7/17:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661543500-869926-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>But the weird thing comes now, when just a month later (I want to emphasize that it was just in a month), the CEO woke up and realized that his free trials were over.</p>\n\n<p>Message of 8/16:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-26/1661543702-354486-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>Sincerely, I am very sorry that users fall for this type of scams and lies.</p> \n\n<p>In closing, I would like you to attach proof if possible, so that you can demonstrate that what you are saying is real and you are not just trying to defend or hide a lie.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5755"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2018"}}}}]}

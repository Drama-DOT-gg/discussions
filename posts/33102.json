I crashed the wings in seconds. SSH also crashed with that.</p>\n\n<p>Second verse, HostingRemade uses Contabo for a good 50% of there servers, here's your proof by the way, image attached and here are the ips. <br>\nDE2 = 161.97.184.3 SG1 = 194.233.73.113</p>\n\n<p>Third verse, Downtime. Do you know how many times I had to work all nighters to setup DDos protection? We still have downtimes and 90% of the time Pterodactyl Wings don't even work due to Cloudflare.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth verse, Never get's things done. I have asked dchu to do things and they never get done. A prime example of this is the WHMCS theme / template and the HostingRemade website. It's still not done to this day.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth verse, Same password, FOR EVERYTHING. Did you know that almost all of the HostingRemade dedicated server's and vpses use the same password? Yea you heard right, it's legit true! It's pretty confusing isn't it?</p>\n\n<p>Sixth verse, Over allocation.

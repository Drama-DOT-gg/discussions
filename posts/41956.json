I do try to make sure the software is actually locked down for security and privacy reasons.<br>\nI'm going to get in touch with the owner and make sure the app used correctly, if they're using my code then I'll just keep tabs on it.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, I believe an Electron app can be harmful and can be used as a token logger. As you can include extra executable files using Electron Builder and have a button or an 'onload' function execute this file. Again, I keep it locked down as much as I can.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3377"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1600"}}}}]}

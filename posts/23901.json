You could have just used one of our support methods and or sent me a DM however you decided to be a jack ass and make a post about it. I tried asking you why you were cracking cPanel and got banned and IP grabbed.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/881/21\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"23901\">Jerome</a> Calling me skid just because I exposed you?

I am not the one grabbing peoples IPs and cracking cPanel. You wanna talk about legality? Cracking cPanel is illegal. Even if you didn't crack it, you knowingly used it and banned me for pointing it out.</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone here is a law expert. If an SLA needs to be publicly shown, DM us and tell us. Your other post has been closed because of your idiocy.</p> \n\n<p>Like I said this issue will be sorted and that is all. <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Robert\" class=\"UserMention\">@Robert</a> this can now be marked as resolved and closed.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"881"}}}}]}

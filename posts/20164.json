So basically I worked on a botlist for discord with him, then I suddenly released that techdude likes to ping people a lot in announcements and is very immature. So I asked him if he was underage, and after some convincing he admitted he was underage. I have some proof <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-02/1625236134-134264-screen-shot-2021-06-30-at-112726-am.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nand that's proof he admitted it him self.

But, I don't see why you'd be reporting him to the police. Why would he want to send his parents' ID? Ah yes, lets send a picture of their ID which has their address on it to some random stranger on the internet, sounds totally safe. Just report him to Discord and move on, don't make it such a big deal honestly. Also light mode ew.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2839"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"756"}}}}]}

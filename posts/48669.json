That was to defend his old host, Hosticy, that used to run on MOFH (My own free host). ItsGamingTube has been able since his first days in this community to demonstrate his immaturity and sense of skidding projects from other people. <br>\nThis is ItsGamingTube: The rise and fall of a skid: a tale full of ban evasions, skidded projects and advertisements. <br>\nOn 2021's April fools day ItsGamingTube got banned from WinterHoax, for then creating an account on 15/04/2021 on the new Drama.gg! A month later the advertisements began, and he started advertising his new host, Hosticy.ml, basically everywhere. Go ahead, search it on Reddit. Search it on Google. You'll find this thing everywhere, he even advertised that on InfinityFree's forums (<a href=\"https://forum.infinityfree.net/t/itsgamingtube-rant-topic/45423/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://forum.infinityfree.net/t/itsgamingtube-rant-topic/45423/</a>). 5 months passed, and ItsGamingTube was back: he made a thread exposing a scam website. The poorly made thread even contained a few links with proof, the only issue is that they were links for his own website, that could’ve possibly been an IP grabber.<br>\nAfter making a low quality few threads he got banned from the platform, along with his threads.<br>\nThe next day he was back with his alts again (the user Tomas was the first one to notice, congrats!).<br>\nAfter this he got banned again, again and again. <br>\nDuring his ban period ItsGamingTube experimented the good feeling of joining free hosts on Discord, these include Artiom's Hosting, FalixNodes and DanBot Hosting. I'll only say that he got banned from Artiom's Host for using multiple accounts to get extra servers, he got banned from Falix for his childish behaviour and demonstrated his inability of chatting with someone without offending certain groups of people in DanBot Hosting.<br>\nAfter that, his bot, StarWatcher, was hacked and nuked the bot's own support server. The bot's MongoDB database was also erased and sold on a dark web forum because of his poor practices at protecting user data. (Source: a leaks Pastebin).<br>\nThat confirmed the fall of ItsGamingTube.<br>\nAnd here we are, today, ItsGamingTube is still ban evading here with the name of \"SVR\" on the forum and “Sir exploiter Roblox\" on the drama Discord. <br>\nI hope you enjoyed this thread, hopefully you’ll also enjoy discussing about him in the thread's replies. I’ll be posting all the screenshots for proof / references in my next messages.

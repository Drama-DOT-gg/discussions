But as of recent conversations and experience's from users, it appears that their hosting company is doing unethical acts.</p> \n\n<h3>Advertising on Other People's Host</h3>\n<p>Context: Apparently the owner of SnowyNodes, brycecarpenter#2962, decided it would be a clever idea to advertise his own hosting server onto other hosting service's discords. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-26/1666750100-993651-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-26/1666750113-278543-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The owner, \"henryy\" attempted to confront Bryce for why he was advertising on his server. Bryce did not seem to show any hint of respect and decided to insist that \"this was funny.\"</p> \n\n\n<h3>Copying NameCheap's ToS</h3>\n<p>What's interesting about their ToS is that in some places of the document, it contains the name of NameCheap. Ex. \"<em>Namecheap has the absolute right, in its sole discretion, to terminate its Services and close Your account.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>After doing some background research, it appears that they <strong>copied it from Namecheap.</strong><br>\nSnowyNode's ToS: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wT7phHnh9NQIYZFeuFPZJ_3SuMuD7YgzJ09NM1i3dHQ/edit\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wT7phHnh9NQIYZFeuFPZJ_3SuMuD7YgzJ09NM1i3dHQ/edit</a><br>\nNameCheap's ToS: <a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/legal/hosting/tos/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.namecheap.com/legal/hosting/tos/</a></p>\n\n<p>Ex.<br>\nNameCheap's First Two Lines of the ToS:<br>\n<em>You agree that Namecheap may modify this Agreement and the Services it offers to You from time to time. You agree to be bound by any changes Namecheap may reasonably make to this Agreement when such changes are made.</em></p>\n\n<p>SnowyNode's First Two Lines of their ToS:<br>\n<em>You agree that SnowyNode may modify this Agreement and the Services it offers to You from time to time. You agree to be bound by any changes Namecheap may reasonably make to this Agreement when such changes are made.</em></p>\n\n<p>The funny part about SnowyNode's ToS is the fact that they FORGOT to remove NameCheap's name in some areas of their ToS.</p> \n\n\n\n<h3>Stealing Another Website's Design</h3>\n<p>\"Host\" &gt; <a href=\"https://snowynode.co.uk/hosting-cloud.html\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://snowynode.co.uk/hosting-cloud.html</a> (Origin: <a href=\"https://snowynode.co.uk/index.html\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://snowynode.co.uk/index.html</a>)<br>\nTheme &gt; <a href=\"https://madebydesignesia.com/themes/hostco/hosting-cloud.html\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://madebydesignesia.com/themes/hostco/hosting-cloud.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Apparently you can trace back the design of their website to another website's theme. Even if they bought it (which is a doubt since zero evidence conclude so), they appear to forgot to properly finish their page.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-26/1666750316-564009-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-10-26/1666750323-81644-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Violating FiveM Tos</h3>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://snowynode.co.uk/whmcs/index.php?rp=/store/gta-v-hosting\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://snowynode.co.uk/whmcs/index.php?rp=/store/gta-v-hosting</a><br>\nIn addition, they make profit by violating FiveM's ToS.

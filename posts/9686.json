They fix the important shit which should have been up to standards before release.</p> \n\n<p>As a note, I am not in any way affiliated to DijxCloud, I just don't like it when little kid bitch at nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I agree they should have not released into \"beta\" without a proper TOS, but they fixed it.

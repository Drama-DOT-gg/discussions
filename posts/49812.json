Not because you were trying to become a legit company. Stripe does give you the option, but I could as easily make a website that says I'm the CEO of Twitter, but does that make me the CEO of Twitter? Of course not. Yeah and those have permits and licenses, show us your license.</p>\n\n<p>\"I\"? used outdated billing code. I will repeat what I said to Zaross, all I did was dump the files on my pc to google drive, at which point Voll found an UNENCRYPTED .env file. Also again, I wasn't involved in any one that. I \"stole\" user data? Yet again false, your \"proof\" uses an IP which I had up until you \"fired\" me (for disrespect, show me that, oh and include you randomly switching from laid back joking to business serious every other day), I then requested you remove all my personal info, INCLUDING the IP, which I see you did not, and because I know we didn't get rid of Voll's info when we(mostly you) fired him, I decided to change my IP, if you want proof, all I'm saying is it ends in .74, yeah no I'm not gonna leak my IP on drama.gg. Show voll threatening your family, go on. And again, I'm not responsible for something he did. No, they actually contacted me, good try tho.  I mean if you deem removing jeroen and manu from the CF to \"fix it\", then so be it, but it was literally a key you had to revoke, i don't see the experitse in doing that. Also we had this thread planned for like what? A few weeks before Voll noticed the keys and acted.</p>\n\n<p>So what if they aren't active, it's still unencrypted details, which if they were to be active, could very much cause harm to you.</p>\n\n<p>\"Cheers!\"</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4739"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"49814"},{"type":"posts","id":"49817"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4739","attributes":{"username":"TheYeetster","displayName":"TheYeetster","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Bzg1ypsYeixFBMGH.png","slug":"TheYeetster","joinTime":"2021-10-29T17:14:08+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":146,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-03-12T21:57:04+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"7096","attributes":{"username":"Pengu","displayName":"Pengu","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/1eQRNFMALLaeH1YR.png","slug":"Pengu"}},{"type":"users","id":"7095","attributes":{"username":"Zaross","displayName":"Zaross","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Gorern2GnUxdN0Hj.png","slug":"Zaross"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2115","attributes":{"title":"Galactiq - A facade of Fraud and Theft","slug":"2115-galactiq-a-facade-of-fraud-and-theft","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"49814","attributes":{"number":12,"createdAt":"2023-02-19T20:02:48+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2115/10\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"49812\">TheYeetster</a> You claimed to change your IP address and yet it was used February 14th of this year to gain access under YOUR old company email. I did not remove this IP because when you requested I remove it  you hadn't hacked in? I gave you the data off the Repo's like you asked (Your data not ours) and deleted them.

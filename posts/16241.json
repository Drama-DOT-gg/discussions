Anyways, I was kinda prepared because you leaked the fact that you will create this post.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li><p>You wanted to use me for money!<br>\nWhere did I make you give me money, huh? I didn't force you to do that, I just wanted you to help me pay for nodes, not forcing you to do so or something like that.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You demoted me for no reason!<br>\nYes, I did demote you, but not really. First of all, I made you management instead of executive, but then you were mad because I gave you a role a lower behind executive but with all perms except admin. I then got mad because you changed the server name in Discord to „MJCloud · Free hosting”, and then we got into a 'fight'.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You are a kid! You admitted to being 9 years old!<br>\nI am not a fucking kid, I am a teen you dumbass. Anyways, the „I'm 9 years old\" thing was a joke. You never get jokes, don't you?</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You were swearing<br>\nYes, I was swearing. Why do you have anything against that?</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Because that's what a kid would do (swear)<br>\nAgain, I am a teen, you dumbass. I'm not a fucking kid. And if I was a kid, I would have probably backed up and closed my host, with no response to this thread.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You are toxic<br>\nI am toxic when you fucking make me mad, like right now. I'm usually calm, and not toxic, but you are making me mad like no one else. I think you should have a reward for that.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>MJCloud doesn't have ToS or PP<br>\nYes, for now of course. I'm still working on it, and working on 6 different things is hard - dashboard, node uptime, new nodes, checking drama.gg and searching for MJCloud every day, maintaining the server, and making ToS &amp; PP. Please understand this, I might release the ToS and PP tomorrow.</p></li></ol>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3179"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"555"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"16245"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3179","attributes":{"username":"honk","displayName":"honk","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/sSMWNbIdNt1e9Ckk.png","slug":"honk","joinTime":"2021-03-05T13:13:35+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":87,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-08-31T21:28:21+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":".","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3257","attributes":{"username":"RumGuru","displayName":"RumGuru","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/LfdbF5Ex7oM05L6h.png","slug":"RumGuru"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"555","attributes":{"title":"MJCloud - honk #9930 - /toxic/underage/no tos&pp/scamming","slug":"555-mjcloud-honk-9930-toxicunderageno-tosppscamming","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"16245","attributes":{"number":8,"createdAt":"2021-05-24T09:23:51+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/555/4\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"16241\">honk</a></p> \n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>You did want to use me for money, you asked me for gpu and my pc specs so i can mine for you.\n <ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\" start=\"2\"><li>thats true but you still demoted for no reason</li>\n  <li>i mean you are acting like a kid and you said it multiple times</li>\n  <li>Yea i do have something against that, you are swearing at me and saying dumb stuff</li>\n   <li>Most kids on internet swear like crazy<br>\n    6.You are always toxic even to your host users</li>\n    <li>MJCloud is working for weeks already, even maybe a month!</li></ol></li></ol>\n      <br>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3257"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"555"}}}}]}

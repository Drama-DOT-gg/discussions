I wasn't even going to open source my ProxyBot. I shouldn't need to give myself credit for something I wasn't going to give other people. I only gave Bocon so he could run it for his hosting at the time. I open-sourced it to get credit since he seems to want to take all of it for making half the things he stole but since it is now open sourced I think I should get credit for him using it.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3669"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1919"}}}}]}

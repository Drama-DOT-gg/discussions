HostNexxus, LLC (as per their twitter) is \"A Low cost, Easy to Maintain Discord Bot &amp; Shared Website Hosting Company.\" According to their most recent Discord announcement they have been around since August of 2020. This is credible by looking through their Discord.</p>\n\n<p>Let me introduce myself. Hi! I'm Drake, otherwise known as DaDrake#7921. While I believe everyone has a chance to correct themselves, I don't believe that it should be at the cost of others. In this case, let me introduce you into why I believe HostNexxus, LLC is \"unprofessional\", committing \"Illegal Activites\", and whatever else I set the topic tag as.</p>\n\n<p>Unprofessional &amp; Illegal Activites. Upon joining their Discord I was greeted with an interesting overview. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-10/1633900218-360680-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nNothing out of the ordinary, but it looks respectful at best. They do happen to do Discord tickets, which is scummy, but otherwise typical of a Discord host. I digress, onto the more pressing matters.<br>\nI asked about their LLC status, (NV20201890838) and why the status had changed from \"active\" to \"default\". I was met with abusive comments from their partner Itszylus and from one of their staff members Colin. Colin who had repeatedly informed me that he was on his way out after submitting a 2 week notice, kept telling me to ignore it and stated that it was just an error. I kept asking about it, only to be met with a chat clearing and nothing happening. (If you did not know, in the state of Nevada where HostNexxus, LLC happens to be registered, if your LLC status turns to default, it means you didn't pay the state and your LLC is now invalid, and as a result, you must pay late fees, plus registration, plus submitting some other documents to reinstate your LLC.) Essentially, continuing to state that you hold an LLC, when you actually don't, seems a bit fraud-y (wouldn't you agree?).</p>\n\n<p>Recently, HostNexxus, LLC happened to have a 16 hour downtime, and when pressed about this matter, <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-10/1633900755-691748-image.png\" title=\"\"> (downtime as posted in #status-announcements) the chat was cleared in both their #general and #status-announcements. It seems like they don't want to answer our questions because they don't know what they are doing. Here is the only response one of my partners received about the downtime. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-10/1633900877-167160-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>So, what do you guys think? I would consider this to be a fraudulent operation, ran by kids who don't understand what they are doing. As of now, I'm banned from their Discord but I would love to see the community go in and ask the same questions I have asked (mainly about falsely portraying as an LLC) and at least get them shut down. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-10/1633900992-592966-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Their discord can be found at <a href=\"https://www.hostnexxus.com/discord\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.hostnexxus.com/discord</a>.</p> \n\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4597"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1081"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4597","attributes":{"username":"Drake","displayName":"Drake","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/yLtJa9Tl7r9oC5qT.png","slug":"Drake","joinTime":"2021-10-09T18:32:32+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":3,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-10-22T03:20:51+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1081","attributes":{"title":"HostNexxus | Invalid, Immature, and Irresponsible.","slug":"1081-hostnexxus-invalid-immature-and-irresponsible","isApproved":true}}]}

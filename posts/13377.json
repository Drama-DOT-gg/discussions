Poeple have rights to critise. If he said Falix staff are dicks then there was a reason to mute for swearing. But I don't see anything like staff disrespect in \"falix staff is trash\" rather than factual critisim. And still About resign Yes I resigned cuz of the illogical and shit behaviour of other members which I couldn't handle anymore. (mainly you).<br>\n The logic falix staffs uses are sun and moon which never gonna meet. And I was support team but the only shit I didn't had access to was logs. And I can clearly say that Ass I mean Ash is a clear dickhead. Not only me saying it other staff members who resigned says it too and Ash is one of the reason for them resign as well.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2801"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2801","attributes":{"username":"DeadBush","displayName":"DeadBush","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/XbjcjyJPwRXjAX5J.png","slug":"DeadBush","joinTime":"2020-09-13T20:26:47+00:00","discussionCount":16,"commentCount":295,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-10-07T06:26:03+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"I'm DeadBush","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"34","attributes":{"title":"Lamaker/ItzAwesome/Lily/Pamar | FalixNodes/Falix.gg & PrimeSRV","slug":"34-lamakeritzawesomelilypamar-falixnodesfalixgg-primesrv","isApproved":true}}]}

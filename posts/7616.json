For Sparked Host LLC, this thread is not deserved or should be open at all, if someone wants to take things serious, they would understand that legal actions should've been taken or somewhat speak first to them, currently, with what you guys have in hand against Sparked Host LLC is nothing more than Jen being guilty.<br>\nAbout your disclaimer, I believe he acknowledge and agreed to them, unsure, however, should be followed.</p>\n\n<p>To add to this, since I believe people will know me of defending Sparked Host LLC or representing them, I'm not representing currently nor am I defending Sparked Host LLC, I'm clearing out a few things that should be made.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,<br>\nAnthony.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3168"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"221"}}}}]}

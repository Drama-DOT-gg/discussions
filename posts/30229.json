I've had to deal with someone that had been waiting for a donator server for over 3 months. At that point I was just done because I had school coming up, so I just went inactive completely in the server. Although Dan is a great guy, and I like his personality, he can make some awful decisions and doesn't seem to really care about reputation.</p>\n\n<p>Dan has helped me get my own hosting service Vertix Hosting get a jump start, and I thank him for that, but that doesn't justify the other things, such as nodes being down, donators not being able to access the donator node in its entirety, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I truly hope DanBot Hosting gets the refresh it truly needs, and thrives on to be the best free host out there, but until then, all clients must wait. I still will recommend DanBot to Developers looking for a <em>free</em> host and don't wanna go out of their way to pay for one like every normal person to ever exist. But cheap devs can be cheap devs I guess.</p> \n\n<p>And to Dan, you can make the changes that will make this host better, the real question is, when will you do it...</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3014"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1071"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"4197"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"30232"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3014","attributes":{"username":"DevNoah","displayName":"DevNoah","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/jq9CzS8Rq109qFTM.png","slug":"DevNoah","joinTime":"2021-01-20T06:32:58+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":8,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-10-17T20:17:04+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4197","attributes":{"username":"Cnnn666","displayName":"Cnnn666","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/PMgsY1ldkzME4yFO.png","slug":"Cnnn666"}},{"type":"users","id":"4585","attributes":{"username":"Milo","displayName":"Milo","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/kIP5NrHmfGNEfzsM.png","slug":"Milo"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1071","attributes":{"title":"DBH Scummy Hosting","slug":"1071-dbh-scummy-hosting","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"30232","attributes":{"number":16,"createdAt":"2021-10-07T01:01:07+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1071/13\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"30229\">DevNoah</a> Ayo, Don't forget Dan Has DDoSed your Panel before on Stream ðŸ˜ƒ</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4585"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1071"}}}}]}

So, Willy can be seen using \"bed\" instead of \"bad\" almost all the time. And, the reason why all of my members were banned was \"bed af server\". Proof is in the screen shots below<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/837988253519839292/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/837988600749752320/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nIf that was not enough, the bot that was used Lawliet Host (our official bot) banned everyone. Guess what? The only 2 people I trusted enough to give the token to were Aypro and Willy. Aypro is still trusted by me and he has no reason to raid as we are in this business together and both are making profits. Plus, he is not dumb enough to only raid the server. If Aypro wanted to ruin the company, he has the access to panel, Discord, all the VPS's, the PayPal, and pretty much everything as an admin. So, that just leaves out Willy as the only suspect for the raid. So, I think we can conclude that Willy raided Lawliet.Host's server.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if that proof was not good enough, he holds grudges against me for making drama.gg threads against him, and not trusting him after he scammed me and did more scummy things.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh, and literally no one else had the token. So, who else could do it?</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3351"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"438"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3351","attributes":{"username":"MysteriousK69","displayName":"MysteriousK69","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/ABOR5lBU0cUCwlDP.png","slug":"MysteriousK69","joinTime":"2021-04-08T05:55:35+00:00","discussionCount":10,"commentCount":283,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-08-01T08:13:45+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Giving the best hosting at Lawliet.Host","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"438","attributes":{"title":"Willy Pro 7 | 12 year old kid | raiding servers | illegal operation | and, more","slug":"438-willy-pro-7-12-year-old-kid-raiding-servers-illegal-operation-and-more","isApproved":true}}]}

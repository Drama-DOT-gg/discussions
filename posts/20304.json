Which is obviously a problem for the host that you work on as you literally <strong>don't give a shit</strong>, I know everything you stated here is opinion based, but it's the one example I can give that you will have a lot of knowledge about and would know what is going on and the things we're criticizing it for.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> DDOS won't improve your life nor will it destroy your enemy host, relax</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't recall any reputable member of Drama.gg, that we know of, or have encouraged to perform a DDOS, we only encourage it strictly for testing purposes and with permission. You can't generalize drama.gg as a whole doing these actions, that's the problem of the individuals themself.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> To begin with, most hosts today have one goal: make money.<br>\nOf course, as an organization, you want to make profit in some way, but this is the ONLY thing being looked for in today's hosts. In return, cheap and crappy services are given to children to tolerate.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is the main issue we have against new hosts, everyone complains about every free host is on here, etc. the site a way to make users know about why they should avoid a certain host or company or person.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> Drama.gg won't be able to solve this</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20296\">ely</a> This site is niche, and will never solve problems the way it operates, and I think that is beginning to be accepted by those who use it here: a forum about hosts, just that.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>I and pretty sure other people in the community are very open about this, but it is always great to be updated and know how to avoid getting, as they say it \"exposed\", or basically to start a company without problems or issues, etc.</p>\n\n\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"762"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"20308"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"7","attributes":{"username":"Jedrik","displayName":"Jedrik","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/DQfRHtHKGcVT6AZv.png","slug":"Jedrik","joinTime":"2020-07-10T10:17:59+00:00","discussionCount":16,"commentCount":689,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-05-17T18:19:08+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Papi Jedrik — 07/29/2021\nI can't handle this community anymore, it was fun at the start with winterhoax, i'll save you the hassle, i'm resigning\n\nSloth — 07/29/2021\nmy thoughts exactly","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3033","attributes":{"username":"_MrKnight_","displayName":"_MrKnight_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/kaGjEYVq3iidrUkK.png","slug":"_MrKnight_"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"762","attributes":{"title":"Hosts/Drama.gg opinions.","slug":"762-hostsdramagg-opinions","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"20308","attributes":{"number":12,"createdAt":"2021-07-03T14:14:53+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/762/9\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"20304\">Jedrik</a> Jedrik let me say , u remember Jen right , he threatened me saying he will ddos my site , he told it in this forum , if you want proof go to rednodes/redhost thread</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3033"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"762"}}}}]}

Everyone knows that no matter if you are racist and toxic or not you wont admit it to keep the reputation and stability of your provider as stable and secured as you possibly can. The purpose of this thread was to make the community itself be aware that you should not be involved as a customer/client at this provider because of the owners <strong>behaviour and attitude</strong>, and the thread just spun out of control with all the arguments etc.</p>\n\n<p>DNS records were never mentioned in this thread so the fact that others have brought it up has sort of confused me and obviously confused you too, so lets just ignore all of that discussion about Azure etc. What I want from this thread is not an argument but simply just making the public aware of these activities and that it isn't a host which should be trusted and respected within our community.</p>\n\n<p>You know you won't admit it, even though it's true. That's just basic human nature, what would really help is an apology for the previous actions but that rarely ever happens in these cases. I will let you decide your next steps for you and Blazing Host, however personally I believe an apology should be made out the kindness of your own heart.</p> ","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4742"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1928"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4742","attributes":{"username":"WhenUHackUNoob","displayName":"WhenUHackUNoob","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"WhenUHackUNoob","joinTime":"2021-10-30T08:10:57+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":42,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-02-25T17:30:25+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1928","attributes":{"title":"Blazing Host | Bad owner, Racist, Rude","slug":"1928-blazing-host-bad-owner-racist-rude","isApproved":true}}]}

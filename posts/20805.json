So today I came to an interesting hosting, 'ReleHost', they are Spanish, so some of you may not understand the messages, but I'll translate a bit.</p>\n\n<p>This is my first thread, please don't hate if it is bad.</p>\n\n<p>They have a privacy policy in website, but not a TOS, they have TOS at discord for any reason.</p>\n\n<p>First, they sell FiveM servers, and that's illegal if you are not authorised. I even asked some people in drama.gg server to make sure I was right.</p>\n\n<p>I've talking with the owners, and they were very nervous, saying that I would need to send a proof in 5 minutes or I would get banned.</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625608809-119957-fa0556fe-3be4-4359-8e1c-034e39404c43.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I sent the stuff, and the owner said that a FiveM \"Expert\" would talk to me. He did, and he limited to say that the TOS was saying that server owners cannot get benefit, not the host owners. I asked again and checked myself to make sure i was correct, and yeah I was.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625608929-774353-0cc341dc-ad63-403e-9a84-45943691b094.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nThey saying that server owners cannot get benefit</p>\n\n<p>I've tried to make them understand that selling FiveM without consent was against the TOS, and they were saying no every time. I've spent a lot of time talking with em and they didn't wanted to fix their problems</p>\n\n<p>He even said that point 7 (That basically says that server owner has the right to move the files and stuff like that) mean that you can sell FiveM servers.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625609019-696770-cd28bf2e-4a21-4de1-a84d-ea8bb881038e.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nThey saying that point 7 means you can sell FiveM servers.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I am not judging this part because I have no servers with them, but they sell 4gb ram for 1$, a bit sus.</p>\n\n\n<p>Also, in the short time I was investigating them  (For about 5 days), main website, panel and everything went down a lot of times, and they didn't announce downtime or something like that.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625609088-214331-f6f4b0f1-a2f6-44d4-b35d-72f3540c64cb.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625609088-396990-80655b8a-fd08-451c-b47b-59b3ad733a10.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>And for any reason, almost everyone that left a review at the feedback channel left the server<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-06/1625609233-21986-4838ba0b-88e9-469d-a602-02335faef4b8.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nAnd more, and they got also kinda bad reviews.</p>\n\n<p>They have a rule that says no disrespect but at some point they ded in the ticket, i re-asked and said we already told you that it's legal, shut up, but in Spanish, they have no idea of what is legal and what isn't.</p>\n\n<p>Personally i think it is a hobby, even when you buy they can say please wait some time, we are configuring panel, when i guess they should have everything configured when they open</p>\n\n<p>And server is horribly made, just look at it, even a server with 4 channels looks better</p>","editedAt":"2021-07-06T22:20:48+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3291"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3291"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"772"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3291"},{"type":"users","id":"3427"},{"type":"users","id":"3785"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3291","attributes":{"username":"Willypro7","displayName":"Willypro7","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/6ejKNQiaajcKH8Zi.png","slug":"Willypro7","joinTime":"2021-03-29T16:39:19+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":172,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-07-24T13:34:58+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Lol","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3427","attributes":{"username":"babyharpseal","displayName":"babyharpseal","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/gIjyTXWXF9yBA4uq.png","slug":"babyharpseal"}},{"type":"users","id":"3785","attributes":{"username":"Mohamol344","displayName":"Mohamol344","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/yf8B5bZaOTN3XwRo.png","slug":"Mohamol344"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"772","attributes":{"title":"Relehost","slug":"772-relehost","isApproved":true}}]}

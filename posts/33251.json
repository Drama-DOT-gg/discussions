Now you are giving fake screenshots as well. We never used any trial VPS. Ask <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Oliver1234dotdot\" class=\"UserMention\">@Oliver1234dotdot</a> or guldkage For proof. They were with me since the beginning of CygenNodes. And also not a single staff has access to our nodes then how come you tested it. If you think I am lying ask our executives Oliver and Guldkage who are the only ones that have access to our system.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4246"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1157"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"33298","attributes":{"number":47,"createdAt":"2021-10-29T07:02:09+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1157/3\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"33251\">Vrillex</a> u dont get allowed to use it first as a staff what shit u talking lol</p>\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4737"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1157"}}}}]}

He even went as far as to selling \"premium\" version of his bot. I had to close source it for him to run without my updates ðŸ¤®</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631537977-207520-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>look at the folder named \"opbot\" (his bot) and admitting of running my code<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631538244-663705-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n<h2>^^ above image also proves that he doesnt know shit about coding</h2>\n<h1>2 copied my afk page</h1>\n<h3>he copied my afk page without giving creds ofc, claimed that \"he made the afk page\"</h3>\n\n<p>what a terrible way to make money, <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/TejasLamba\" class=\"UserMention\">@TejasLamba</a> if you wanna run a fuckin afk page then make sure to change the arc setup next time</p>\n\n<h3>I was making money from his afk page cuz his skiddin ass couldnt understand how to change the fuckin arc config</h3>\n\n<p>proof the site was mine:</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631538154-420266-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>him admitting that the page was mine and that he doesnt care<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631538441-928816-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>lol making money from his afk page xD<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631538172-387580-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I was gonna fill the dmca form but I didnt bothered cuz I made like 15$ off of his page ðŸ™‚</p>\n\n<h2>3 copied my npm package</h2>\n\n<p>my npm package has been used quite alot by the discord bot developers over  the past few months, ofc he will skid every successful project of mine right?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631538547-210973-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>I think we all know that they are not capable of running their own host. After the \"colorful\" past with original developers they copied from (including me). I bet they dont even know the basic linux cmds, let alone running a fuckin host with free un-modified themes and freenom domains with absolutely no coding experience.</p>\n\n<p>they are just 12yr old salty indian kids without any money, running their only server on digitalocean free creds.</p>\n\n<p>ofc they dont care about how much hardwork the developers put into writing their own projects, they just copy the whole fuckin shit and claim ownership of it. They know nothing about coding / programming and are doing all this just to gain popularity imo</p>\n\n<h2>this is just funny</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-09-13/1631538720-582373-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>skid accusing a skid of skidding lmfao</p>\n\n<h2>And if you are a dev for rainbowstudios then dont even dare fuckin claiming that all of this isnt true, all proof is attached above.</h2>\n\n<h1>Thank you all for coming to my podcast, have a nice day.</h1>","editedAt":"2021-09-13T14:01:06+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4457"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4457"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"983"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"4457"},{"type":"users","id":"4468"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1088"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4457","attributes":{"username":"AssassiN","displayName":"AssassiN","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/istFYsluVhGKcjyQ.png","slug":"AssassiN","joinTime":"2021-09-12T06:06:54+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":82,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-09-23T06:06:24+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4468","attributes":{"username":"AndreaMiele","displayName":"AndreaMiele","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Cpjp3u9QDb7fM6uv.png","slug":"AndreaMiele"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"983","attributes":{"title":"Asjad & Rainbow Studio Hosting - Scummy, Lying and Stealing Clients","slug":"983-asjad-rainbow-studio-hosting-scummy-lying-and-stealing-clients","isApproved":true}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1088","attributes":{"userId":4468,"postId":28226,"reactionId":1}}]}

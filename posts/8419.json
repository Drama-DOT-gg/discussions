Here are my thoughts:</strong></p>\n\n<p>So for about a month ago, I joined SkyCastle Hosting. I am a developer of the host. But then we got hoaxed and a guy called Rihard took away all our VPSs. Then I created RedGate Hosting. I thought I should give Rihard a chance, so he came back to help working at RedGate. Today, he did something hilarious. He raided Ectrix Host's bot and the bot went crazy, deleting everything. He even took away his VPSs for the second time for no reason. At last he said he didn't do it and he is very rude and forced me to ban him from RedGate forever.<br>\nI was thinking why he even did that? I just want to make a host with my friends including him and make some money. But his wrong desicions made me feel like he is scamming and hacking innocent people randomly.<br>\nHis Discord tag is @᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼#0707 and his user ID is 665956339033309203 just in case you got scammed by him. *I am not here to commit spamming, bullying him, just some information to help you be aware.</p>\n\n<p>BoscoChung</p>","editedAt":"2021-03-10T13:25:18+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3197"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3197"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"262"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3197","attributes":{"username":"BoscoChungFREEMCHosting","displayName":"BoscoChungFREEMCHosting","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/nI6RLA4u7B2vwVqK.png","slug":"BoscoChungFREEMCHosting","joinTime":"2021-03-10T08:50:30+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":35,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-08-04T17:08:03+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"262","attributes":{"title":"Watch out of Hosting Scammers","slug":"262-watch-out-of-hosting-scammers","isApproved":true}}]}

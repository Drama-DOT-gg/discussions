Sole Proprietorship doesn't require a registration, it just gets filled under taxes and that's that (which btw I filed taxes this year ðŸ˜ƒ) Stripe has the option to select it so that they know what your business is. So many business's (not just hosting) are Sole Proprietorship.</p>\n\n<p>Now we could talk about how you used outdated billing code to get into our PayPal, Hetzner Cloud, CloudFlare, and Pterodactyl (Which by the way you stole user data and don't think I don't have proof) or that voll threatened my family. Ever since you were let go you just re-connected with people you deemed our enemies and tried to tag team Galactiq. However everytime you did something you basically called it out and we had it fixed in 5 minutes or less. After we locked you out you posted this acting like you were reporting a fraudulent business but in reality it's just your personal vendetta.</p> \n\n<p>Those database logins haven't been valid for months because we haven't used that database in a long time.</p> \n\n<p>Cheers!</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7096"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"49811","attributes":{"number":9,"createdAt":"2023-02-19T19:41:47+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2115/7\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"49809\">TheYeetster</a></p> \n\n<p><code>when you have no legal documents regarding being one.</code></p>\n\n<p>Again, that would make it an \"unregistered sole prop.\"<br>\nLiterally every other hosting company does this.</p> \n\n<p>As for taxes, I really don't think that every hosting company conveniently pay taxes (other than the fees given by Stripe or Paypal)</p>\n\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7004"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2115"}}}}]}

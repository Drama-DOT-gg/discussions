You can read some pre-generated or already existing legal documents and go off of that, but don't completely copy paste it, just take inspiration from it. and Always expect the user to be stupid, basically  let them know <strong>everything</strong>, where their data goes, how their data is collected, why their data is collected, is their data being shared, what data do you collect, etc.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"737"}}}}]}

ThatHeek has all the money that you had paid for the service it would be up to him to refund you.</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2871"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"989"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2871","attributes":{"username":"RusJS","displayName":"RusJS","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/NlCiT9o37Teub04l.png","slug":"RusJS","joinTime":"2020-10-08T21:07:49+00:00","discussionCount":3,"commentCount":112,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-07-26T14:47:10+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"..","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"989","attributes":{"title":"Hostily Paid Hosting - Mysterously gone","slug":"989-hostily-paid-hosting-mysterously-gone","isApproved":true}}]}

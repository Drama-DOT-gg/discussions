It is also better if they are registered as a company, but that is an <em>optional</em> step, some don't have the money/the age to open a company</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Check how well do they speak english</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they don't speak english/they speak with a very shitty spelling they are most likely 12</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Check if they have reviews</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Better if they have trustpilot, but if they don't, they should have a review/vouch channel in their discord server. Try to see if that is something a normal human will do</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Check how old their service is</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>On average</strong> the older, the better, if a host managed to survive for more than 4/5 months without any issue they are probably legit</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Ask for a free trial</p> </div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, if they offer one. Run diagnostics and try to see if they over-allocate or if they lie about their hardware. Over-allocation is usually shit and if they do that, leave them immediately</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>If the owner's name is Plexed or Badsk, leave immediately.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Come on, let's be real here. He will dataleak and close, no doubt about that</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they use freenom?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they do use freenom go away. If you can pay for your node uptme and can't pay like 20 $ a year get the fuck out</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they use WHMCS? Is it nulled?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they use WHMCS, check if the theme is nulled or no. Again, if you have the money to run a node, and dont have the money to pay 20$ a month you shouldn't be running a host</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they  give invite rewards?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they do, leave them and report to discord. Please</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they hate drama.gg?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If in one of their rules they express their not happiness with d.gg they are not clear.</p> \n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they ask to pay with crypto?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they do, leave them. What kinda retard pays 20$ in crypto a month? come on now</p>\n\n<h3><strong>_ BONUS ROUND_</strong></h3>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Can they provide proof of invoices?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they can, you know they aren't scamming anyone. At least, i think. If they say that \"they gotta wait some time to get the invoice\" or \"i have many accounts, let me find it\" They are carding, leave them</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Are they indian?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>While i have no issue with indians whatsoever watch out for indian kids that dont know how to write. <em>On average</em> You will get scammed</p>\n\n\n<p>I hope that this guide has helped you not get scammed. If i missed something, do let me know and i will add it here</p>\n","editedAt":"2021-12-08T19:27:40+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4955"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4955"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1286"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"37299"},{"type":"posts","id":"37300"},{"type":"posts","id":"37301"},{"type":"posts","id":"37304"},{"type":"posts","id":"37311"},{"type":"posts","id":"37316"},{"type":"posts","id":"38208"}]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1451"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4955","attributes":{"username":"TheAlex","displayName":"TheAlex","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/QCemA07tJA7U6C54.png","slug":"TheAlex","joinTime":"2021-11-28T23:02:52+00:00","discussionCount":4,"commentCount":91,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-10-16T08:55:25+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"I own Argon Hosting kekw","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4443","attributes":{"username":"PolyAnthi","displayName":"PolyAnthi","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/lJQqj8C8YMv4iisj.png","slug":"PolyAnthi"}},{"type":"users","id":"2951","attributes":{"username":"Chirag","displayName":"Chirag","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/EBu92nGgi2Y9tYOD.png","slug":"Chirag"}},{"type":"users","id":"2846","attributes":{"username":"Tomas","displayName":"Tomas","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Q5hYhqTjdnQtMn8K.png","slug":"Tomas"}},{"type":"users","id":"4201","attributes":{"username":"Aaron_","displayName":"Aaron_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/jjT3NoTeKl684ba2.png","slug":"Aaron_"}},{"type":"users","id":"4917","attributes":{"username":"Sky","displayName":"Sky","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/cS8vcbRYULJjEZTr.png","slug":"Sky"}},{"type":"users","id":"4146","attributes":{"username":"Ibrahim","displayName":"Ibrahim","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/kSTDbk63cBUhIlUu.png","slug":"Ibrahim"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1286","attributes":{"title":"How to not get scammed - The suicidal guide","slug":"1286-how-to-not-get-scammed-the-suicidal-guide","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"37299","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-12-08T19:33:02+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1286/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"37298\">TheAlex</a> What is wrong with invite rewards?

Then you basically successfully started a company.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1286/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"37298\">TheAlex</a> Do they use freenom?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>2 Words.

If its Invalid, then you found a NULLED WHMCS license, chances of that being a scam are very likely in this case. However, WHMCS license checking can be very fucky wucky as well. So use multiple devices with multiple browsers to see if its truely invalid or valid.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1286/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"37298\">TheAlex</a> Do they ask to pay with crypto?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Sometimes I just don't understand why people want to sell with crypto- LIKE-</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1286/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"37298\">TheAlex</a> Can they provide proof of invoices?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes- also another way to determine if they're real or not, however, some people may not like to be comfortable. But thats not an excuse, just hide the personal info like; your name, your address, phonenumber, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If they deny, and you most likely get banned. Then you found a scam host.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Are they indian?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>This doesnt matter what their race, or ethnicity, it goes by what their personality is or whether if they're a jerk.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this comment helps too! &lt;3 😃</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4917"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1286"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"38208","attributes":{"number":17,"createdAt":"2021-12-16T19:35:48+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1286/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"37298\">TheAlex</a> Are they indian?</p>\n\n<p>While i have no issue with indians whatsoever watch out for indian kids that dont know how to write.

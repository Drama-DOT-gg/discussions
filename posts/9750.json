So, while browsing for good and cheap dedicated server providers I stumbled upon VelocityNode.net (They are not the scammers.). It turns out that they only sold VPS's, I went to their support Discord server and saw the status of one of the employees, it said \"Hey You! Yes, You. Are You Looking For A Discord Bot To Call Your Own? Look No Further! Prices: $10-$15. Free Hosting Included!\". After looking at the \"Free Hosting Included\" part, I was kinda curious as to what they had to offer. It was a free plan with about 200 MB of RAM, 1 GB of disk (<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119700504510484/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119700504510484/unknown.png</a>). Its shitty but free. I asked to see her other plans if she was selling hosting, she linked me to her Discord server (<a href=\"https://discord.gg/d7AvdVtf\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.gg/d7AvdVtf</a>). While going through the plans, I found this \"- Master Plan: Unlimited Ram, Unlimited CPU, Unlimited Disk And 5 Servers! - $10\". Obviously, it looked suspicious as heck, I asked her about it and she did say that it was indeed unlimited resources (<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119774487838730/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119774487838730/unknown.png</a>). Still thinking its a scam, I asked for her terms of service, she linked me to a channel in her Discord. This is what it said:<br>\n\"BrehHost TOS<br>\nWelcome To BrehHost!</p>\n\n<p>Here At BrehHost We Follow The Same TOS As Discord Has! If You Follow Discord's TOS You Follow Ours. Faillure To Follow The TOS In Any Way Will Result In A Ban Or Kick Based Off The Severity! We Have The Right To Suspend Your Services At Any Time If You Break The TOS Or Leave The Server!</p>\n\n<p>Discord Tos: <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.com/terms</a>\"</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, you read it right. They are a god damn hosting company and are claiming that they use the same TOS as Discord. Upon asking for the privacy policy, they responded with \"i'm still working on it as of now\" (ss for both temrs and privacy policy <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119854825668668/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119854825668668/unknown.png</a>). I thought I would question her further tommorow then make the post. The next day comes and I asked her about her dedi. She responded with \"I don't hhave a dedi XD. But it has 4GB ram, 30GB SSD And 1 IP. I Pai $2 a month for it...\" (<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119929135628318/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119929135628318/unknown.png</a>). So, you telling me that you offering unlimited RAM and disk but you only got 4 GB of RAM and 30 GB of SSD disk? Thats just straight out ridiculous.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3290"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"328"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"9753"},{"type":"posts","id":"9778"},{"type":"posts","id":"19762"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3290","attributes":{"username":"MysteriousK","displayName":"MysteriousK","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/78rodXLw9hML6nqB.png","slug":"MysteriousK","joinTime":"2021-03-29T15:52:55+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":9,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-04-02T11:15:17+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3257","attributes":{"username":"RumGuru","displayName":"RumGuru","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/LfdbF5Ex7oM05L6h.png","slug":"RumGuru"}},{"type":"users","id":"16","attributes":{"username":"Pamar","displayName":"Pamar","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/lr35CsrQrf1b4wyG.png","slug":"Pamar"}},{"type":"users","id":"3323","attributes":{"username":"Jaxon","displayName":"Jaxon","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/cEdJVC49TJDc2SdJ.png","slug":"Jaxon"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"328","attributes":{"title":"Hosting company operating without legal docs.

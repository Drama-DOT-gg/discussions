Saini was partner. And the thing you said owner didn't pay. We have proof we pay more in our host and we have transcript of pay. Other then that Saini just helped him to setup the panel and billing. Which we already taked billing down a week ago. The billing of our was online like 2/3 days. And we don't scam like ya. We give domain for free . We just make it 1/2 invites so we setup or we tell them where to go to make. You can't judge as without even seeing as. And also <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/AYS\" class=\"UserMention\">@AYS</a>  you didn't checked our support service. There is no bad service. I just don't know what you meant but I can say our support service is good. You didn't even check. Also like we did a sort of dm advertise we agree with that. But in future we are taking more good steps without dm advertising. Idk what I just said in this paragraph lol.</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"84"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"154"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"951","attributes":{"number":12,"createdAt":"2020-08-14T13:25:02+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/40/10\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"922\">DevilOfcurse</a> why you guys were mad then huh</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"84"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"154"}}}}]}

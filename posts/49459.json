Owner of a famous host that is called CloudMC and I am here to expose badsk so it's Halex members does not use Halex or any kind of badsk related service in their entire life so I can ruin badsk's reputation with valid proof given in this thread.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a Halex member you need to see this since you are at risk, and this is very recommended for you to read because this involves Scamming, Illegal activities and bad services.</p>\n\n<p>I will probably get hate for doing this thread but I am trying to protect everybody from using his hosting service(s) that are free nor paid.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a Halex member, then you will see absolutely no ads in their client area or either their panel so they can make a little bit of profit from the host. But Badsk claims that they are aprooved in Nitropay but he also says that ads are annoying its members. But you need to think, how can badsk pay I9-13900K nodes that he states to have at the moment and all of the 5ghz CPU's that are overpriced.</p>\n\n<p>The question is simple fellow Halex member, he does not pay at all. He just abuses a lot of providers such as Lightnode, Google Cloud Services, Hetzner, Orcale and even more.<br>\nA guy named \"ItzScripts\" but now his name is alvapepsi is selling GCP accounts for 20$ to badsk, if you go to <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/list/apex_domain/halex.tech\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://securitytrails.com/list/apex_domain/halex.tech</a> you can see all the providers that are easily abusable.</p>\n\n<p>And for a Halex customer who pays badsk to get cheap vpses they are all free trails servers from free credits or abusable hosting providers. Some of his members even got scammed and not refunded after a few days, EVEN WEEKS!</p> \n\n<p>There are a lot of data loss on the host because the providers keep suspending him for abusing the services. We are reporting every provider he is using to that provider so we can let them know that badsk is abusing their services and get his account suspended quicky as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Badsk scams his customers and users of course out of money because he apparently likes money, and he does not give a crap about Halex user base.</p> \n\n<p>I suggest everybody not to use Halex since they are scamming, and they are very unprofessional.<br>\nI'll be posting proofs and everything right now.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"6971"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2078"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"49460"},{"type":"posts","id":"49504"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"6971","attributes":{"username":"Knechtiieeee","displayName":"Knechtiieeee","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Kn2GEDQf18cD1tFu.png","slug":"Knechtiieeee","joinTime":"2022-11-09T07:41:42+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":3,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-12-20T09:27:08+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2819","attributes":{"username":"KIVOX","displayName":"KIVOX","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/4Vk03N61lEPkE5IO.png","slug":"KIVOX"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2078","attributes":{"title":"Halex badsk and alvapepsi known as \"ItzScripts\" scamming its members.","slug":"2078-halex-badsk-and-alvapepsi-known-as-itzscripts-scamming-its-members","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"49460","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-14T21:42:40+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2078/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"49459\">Knechtiieeee</a> More evidence:<br>\nBadsk and ItzScripts (alvapepsi) admits to nuke CloudMC panel.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-14/1668461951-284492-image-40.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-11-14/1668461986-449593-image-23.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe states that he pays for his nodes but he actually isn't.

The license was never nulled and isn't running anymore. I made an account just to look at it. They have stated (On all platoforms) That they where shutting that hosting company down. It's not unusual for a company to leave their services running till either they are purchased by a different company or asked by a provider to take it down. A DMCA Takedown on this is overkill.</p> \n\n<p>On other note it just seems like you are here to start drama about something that was already disproven. No-where in the cancellation process does it state that you would have to take your work down.</p> \n\n<p>I could change my mind buy this company from it's respectful owners and keep the same domain / name running on a renewd license. This happens quite alot and I've done it before.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to discuss further on a civilised matter then you can find me here!<br>\n<a href=\"https://discord.com/users/871877975346405388\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Discord Profile Direct</a></p>\n\n<ul><li>Regards,<br>\n  Nicole H. <br>\n  Serena K.</li></ul>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4451"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"978"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4451","attributes":{"username":"NicoleH","displayName":"NicoleH","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/2hjaTvK2EuDJZKuM.png","slug":"NicoleH","joinTime":"2021-09-11T16:59:53+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":1,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-09-12T23:18:43+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"978","attributes":{"title":"xeinhost.com | Nulled WHMCS","slug":"978-xeinhostcom-nulled-whmcs","isApproved":true}}]}

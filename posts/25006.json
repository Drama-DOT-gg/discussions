Here's the thing, we're not here to represent our companies just to chat and have fun.<br>\nI understand, but that specific conversation about non-profit organizations the members of that community were having was a professional one and even if you are not going to be professional at least acknowledge and take back the feedback whether you are going to implement it or not is secondary.</p>\n\n<p>You have a point, that is overselling and their website needs to be reflected to show the same thing.

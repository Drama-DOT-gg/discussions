The progress on dashactyl is incredibly slow, and jamie's dashactyl egg is pure bullshit, the only part jamie did was like the main file and it's horrible, ok it might be jamie's first time trying out bash, but switch cases/cases exist in every single language which is not an esolang<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-25/1643097848-577140-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nthat has to be the worst code i've seen tbh</p>\n\n<p>and it's fairly clear that jamie does not know how to secure shit at all, the votion api for freenom is ez af to get since it's not even hard to deobfuscate his bash script, the api basically sends a message in a channel if a server tried to use a freenom domain, the api runs on port 6969, which is accessible by the public too so the ip and port <a href=\"http://193.110.160.171:6969/freenom-webhook\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">http://193.110.160.171:6969/freenom-webhook</a> with auth key which i'm not gonna reveal here, it's easily possible to spam pings in votion's egg logs channel if you have the header name which i probably have saved somewhere but cba to find it, just a simple axios request can do the job</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const axios = require('axios')\n\naxios.get(\"http://193.110.160.171:6969/freenom-webhook\", {\n    headers: {\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n        \"Accept\": \"application/json\",\n        \"Authorization\": \"SECRET TOKEN HERE\",\n        \"headernameoverhere\": \"@everyone\"\n    }\n})</code><script async=\"\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" data-hljs-style=\"github\" integrity=\"sha384-oTqfbnKDrROJYNQZI1U//Vr36HEjwJafOewSUYYyb5OXhv0r2qRQcjAP3yXa4HCg\" onload=\"hljsLoader.highlightBlocks(this.parentNode)\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/s9e/hljs-loader@1.0.24/loader.min.js\"></script></pre>\n<p>it's obviously insecure if anyone can ping every single staff member a billion times, i know i made the api, but port 6969 was supposed to be closed to the outside world, and only nginx should be accessing it. but jamie didn't give 2 shits about that. that clearly says how much jamie cares about security.<br>\nAbout jamie's shit code, even when i showed jamie that || exists in bash and i did change it myself since i know jamie's lazy, he somehow reverted back to this bullshit code:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-25/1643098954-198900-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2951"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"42236","attributes":{"number":244,"createdAt":"2022-01-25T14:42:25+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1118/221\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"42201\">Marjan</a> if you have a problem with the support, than don‚Äôt use it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}}}}]}

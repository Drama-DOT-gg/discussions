I never got my scripts added that I paid for and then I go check if they were added and my account was suspended as you see above. The TOS they have posed is some bullshit, but I followed it, it says I have 24 hours to request a refund of services if I'm not happy and I requested for my refund from paypal because I was removed from the discord after posting and asking for help in the general channel after submitting two support tickets and being laughed at so since I wasn't in the discord anymore and I knew it was a waste of time talking to that clown I decided it was easier to go right to paypal and let them know that I had submitted support tickets and wasn't responded to, I was laughed at by the support people IN the discord before being removed, and the fact that \"haylee\" likes to threaten people when she has their ip addresses I wasn't going to play their game of back and fourth adding and deleting back and fourth on discord so the bitch can stop trying to add me unless they just like wasting their time hoping ill friend them cause it isn't happening!</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3077"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"147"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"5776"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3077","attributes":{"username":"gothicflufflepuff","displayName":"gothicflufflepuff","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"gothicflufflepuff","joinTime":"2021-02-01T22:55:19+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":15,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-02-10T04:40:46+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3036","attributes":{"username":"Vanquish","displayName":"Vanquish","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/fggUflkAbpVpGb63.png","slug":"Vanquish"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"147","attributes":{"title":"Century Hosting | Watzon","slug":"147-century-hosting-watzon","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"5776","attributes":{"number":110,"createdAt":"2021-02-03T15:37:33+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/126/92\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"5775\">gothicflufflepuff</a> ah yes providing addon scripts as a hosting provider and selling fivem in general without being permitted.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3036"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"147"}}}}]}

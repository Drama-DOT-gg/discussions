Sure i'm not prepared with privacy policies and my TOS isn't correct. I didn't ask for you to bullshit. All i'm saying is that I offer free hosting. I don't have a lot of customers and most people have enough with 200mb ram. No-one buys the paid ones. Since it's a very small company I don't need a lot of ram and storage. Why would I waste money on an expensive vps when I can get a cheap one for the 5 people that host with me.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3205"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"328"}}}}]}

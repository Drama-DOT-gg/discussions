And What is my past with CatServices?<br>\nThe person which TME refers \"partner\" is me. Yes, I boosted CatServices not to see if there Nodes are bad. Previously I opened a thread and I wrote that CatServices had Bad Performance. Well that time I did not notice they have a process call \"CPU Hibernation\" that usually uses very less CPU when no one is playing the server [Which is absolutely a Genius Idea in my Opinion]. So After sometime Ryan told me how and why my server tps was so low. So I started feeling guilty and so I boosted there server. I did not even asked them to give my resources. I  just opened the ticket and pinged TME with the Screenshot I boosted.</p> \n\n<p>Well you may ask me why I am writing this here?<br>\n I am writing this because At this moment what he refers \"Partner\" and \"Group\" does not mean I am his Partner who tried to bring down CatServices. Instead I boosting is cause I feel Guilty because I complained and wrote a thread without acctually consulting thr Owners regarding the performance.</p> \n\n<p>What is FyreNodes and about it:<br>\nAnd Talking about FyreNodes here, Fallen, Dishit and I own FyreNodes. We did not even released the host and neither the Domain or Nodes are bought yet. I don't know how but TME is mentioning the FyreNodes has Bad nodes which does not make a sense.</p> \n\n<p>About the threads by TME and Luffy on Fallen:<br>\nWell TME is not lying. This is Fallen's usual Habit to say me and TME that we are bad at coding and stuff. But after I became partners with him, he only says TME is bad at coding and said CatServices is bad. Yes it is true that Fallen has said he will DDOS CatServices but I don't really know if he actually means that. Personally Fallen is sometimes really rude to me but he is not bad. He said me he apologized to Luffy but he said luffy said him some bad stuff and blocked him.</p> \n\n<p>My Conclusion: <br>\nYes, Fallen is Salty to TME. I personally tried to fix this problem by making a group but it ended pretty Badly by Luffy starting to be salty to Fallen and Fallen starts and I removed Fallen so I am talk in Peace to Luffy and TME.</p> \n\n<p>Proofs:<br>\n1) TME saying FyreNode has Bad Nodes [Which We don't have  Yet as of the date of the post by TME LOL] - <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/796687684051402772/849594721990344704/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/796687684051402772/849594721990344704/unknown.png</a></p>\n\n<p>2) TME being Salty to Fallen - <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/774312759583309846/774312760170905629/849596854932602920\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.com/channels/774312759583309846/774312760170905629/849596854932602920</a><br>\n3) Luffy saying I am threatening TME  - <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/774312759583309846/774312760170905629/849596986172243978\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.com/channels/774312759583309846/774312760170905629/849596986172243978</a></p>\n\n<p>Anything Else I wanna say?<br>\nWHERE THE HELL IS THE PROOF LUFFY THAT I AM THREATNING TME TBH.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-02/1622630410-13892-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n","editedAt":"2021-06-02T10:40:11+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3685"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3685"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"631"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3685","attributes":{"username":"ItsAceCraft","displayName":"ItsAceCraft","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Ec0ty2rLROFOe5Ub.png","slug":"ItsAceCraft","joinTime":"2021-05-22T13:06:10+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":12,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-07-13T06:47:15+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"631","attributes":{"title":"Fallen#3333","slug":"631-fallen3333","isApproved":true}}]}

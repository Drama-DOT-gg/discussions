I used to be an admin on the server but I'm no longer an admin and I am banned from the server. Anyways, I used to be really good friends with Mr. Ace and I gave him access to my discord bot called <code>Null</code> (yes it was a bad name) because I was friends with him. But after I left Ace's Castle, Mr. Ace was mad and then started using my bot to scam people. He sent over 500 DMs to people in the servers that my bot was in. The thing is, I had given Mr. Ace ownership of the bot (which was very stupid) a couple of weeks ago because he said he was going to verify it on Discord for me, and I forgot this when I left his server. So he kicked me out of my own Discord team and used the bot to advertise his server in people DM's saying <code>free discord nitro</code>. And all these people thought it was me advertising the server and thought that I was a bad person. This happened a few months ago but I actually didn't even know he did this until a bot developer in his server that helped him told me yesterday.</p> \n\n<p>And the thing is, his server isn't even good and they scam discord nitro giveaways.</p>\n\n<p>You can still see my bot Null on top.gg here (<a href=\"https://top.gg/bot/734192520996716556\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://top.gg/bot/734192520996716556</a>) but I think after Mr. Ace used it to spam on Discord servers, Discord noticed and took it down because you can no longer invite it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626346632-92696-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Here are screenshots of proof:</p>\n\n<p>Screenshot of the bot developer in his server saying how Mr. Ace told him to DM the users</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/865174350679900191/865174466849538059/Screenshot_2021-07-15_6.13.05_AM.png?width=725&amp;height=432\" title=\"\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n\n<p>The bot dming people (he renamed the bot to <code>Covid-19)</code>:</p>\n\n<p>![image](<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626346271-364848-image.png\" title=\"\">)</p>\n\n<p>At that time, the server vanity link was <code>discord.gg/server</code>, thats why its says a different server now.</p>\n\n<p>More screenshots:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626346446-763802-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626346461-490367-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626346478-727728-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626346490-143615-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Their server probably faked nitro giveaways:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-15/1626346518-955793-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>He also nuked my server called Launchpad Development but he denied all of it and no one believes me.

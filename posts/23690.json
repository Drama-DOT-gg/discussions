Like that won't be leaked withing the first 5 minutes.  You also have to make a ticket in their discord server to buy a paid plan which just smells like a big scam to me. In my opinion, if you can't afford something like WHMCS or even blesta at the least for paid plans, your host shouldn't be operating as it is obviously underfunded.</p>","editedAt":"2021-08-13T12:07:49+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"41"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"870"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"2977"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"23691"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_","joinTime":"2020-12-13T20:34:09+00:00","discussionCount":8,"commentCount":425,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-25T17:08:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"41","attributes":{"username":"Robert","displayName":"Robert","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/y24i4SFwKYCqRsxU.png","slug":"Robert"}},{"type":"users","id":"2977","attributes":{"username":"Two","displayName":"Two","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Two"}},{"type":"users","id":"50","attributes":{"username":"eraters","displayName":"eraters","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/InBbUrIiLh2f1NZE.png","slug":"eraters"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"870","attributes":{"title":"crystalcloud.xyz | Nulled cpanel","slug":"870-crystalcloudxyz-nulled-cpanel","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"23691","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-08-11T01:25:21+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/870/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"23690\">Jamie_</a> <a href=\"https://cpanel.crystalcloud.xyz/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cpanel.crystalcloud.xyz/</a></p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>remove this, it's a grabify</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"50"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"870"}}}}]}

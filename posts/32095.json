Their servers are absolutely slow, they are being DDoSed and they can't even stop that attack by blocking attacking IP or adding Cloudflare to their website.</p>\n\n<p>Don't use that. When something is not working, they just tell you \"This is in beta\" and won't solve it.</p>\n\n\n<p>The prices are not so cheap as they advertise - you are going to pay 0.50â‚¬ monthly for 32 MB of RAM and 100 MB of Disk for a shared container located on a very slow DDosed server.</p>\n\n<p>They kicked me from their Discord, then I joined back and saw that my message were deleted. The co-owner is like a small kid who can't stand bad true things about yourself. They banned me now from their Discord server. They have also deleted my server without letting me know and I lost my files. How awful this host can be. And ofc they also deleted my account on dashboard and panel.</p>\n\n\n<p>Please avoid using this host or they will make you have bad mad from it.</p>\n\n\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://dash.webshort.uk\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://dash.webshort.uk</a></p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4702"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1140"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"32101"}]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1259"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4702","attributes":{"username":"WolfLover","displayName":"WolfLover","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"WolfLover","joinTime":"2021-10-25T14:16:34+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":10,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-12-23T12:48:11+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4530","attributes":{"username":"CharityLexus","displayName":"CharityLexus","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/v1B9ixaxuFRRyN88.png","slug":"CharityLexus"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1140","attributes":{"title":"Webshort - the worst hosting ever","slug":"1140-webshort-the-worst-hosting-ever","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"32101","attributes":{"number":3,"createdAt":"2021-10-25T14:48:14+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1140/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"32095\">WolfLover</a> you were harassing the owners because you were begging for free credits, and talking about how slow the servers are (when it is in beta, and when you aren't even paying for the service, you were using free credits)</p>\n\n<p>Also i wish i had some good screenshots, but since you got banned all the messages were deleted <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-25/1635173286-520122-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-25/1635173706-618343-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n(timing on screenshots is wrong, i need to fix my settings)<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-25/1635173788-146087-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4530"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1140"}}}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1259","attributes":{"userId":4530,"postId":32095,"reactionId":12}}]}

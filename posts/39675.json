Anyways I recognize, I have been manipulated countless times throughout the process of this server. By Schaefer, Crent, and possibly you. And do to this stress and not having a world of time, I shut down this server. I am only planning on reviving it if I have a really, really, trustable partner. Smooth is a thing of the past, you may close this thread. Skateboardings will not continue to assist me in this journey in the future. I would also like to say you wernt \"always\" owner, you were given it for 5 minutes. Smooth is gone so theres no purpose in continuing.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5224"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1367"}}}}]}

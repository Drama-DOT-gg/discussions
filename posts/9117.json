Just as a side note - our terms weren't great before all of this. We've been working on a phatass terms and conditions which will be up very soon (Disclaimer: We are NOT operating without a TOS. We're not stupid.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm not gonna be all spiteful like you were to me, there's enough negativity in the world. But in future, please make sure you're doing stuff right  before you critique others on the same thing - honestly, it just makes you look like a fool.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: Accept you're wrong, stop acting childish, improve your host based on the criticisms you have recieved here.</p> \n\n<p><em>mic drop</em></p>\n\n","editedAt":"2021-03-21T01:32:33+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3183"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3183"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"173"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"9119"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3183","attributes":{"username":"JexUK","displayName":"JexUK","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"JexUK","joinTime":"2021-03-07T21:58:20+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":83,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-04-03T21:43:54+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"I hate to be political but pineapple goes on pizza ","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"56","attributes":{"username":"Iceey","displayName":"Iceey","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/A21zcRFQYnZkfY0E.png","slug":"Iceey"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"173","attributes":{"title":"Puggo","slug":"173-puggo","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"9119","attributes":{"number":296,"createdAt":"2021-03-21T01:35:07+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/173/294\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"9117\">JexUK</a> and your point was?</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"56"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"173"}}}}]}

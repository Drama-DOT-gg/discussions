Keep your opinion to your self, no one cares about your opinions just like how you care about other people's genders. You're so annoyed by LGBT people shoving their gender in your throat when you're out here shoving your opinion to people <strong>who don't care</strong>, the chat isn't for this. Yes, you're being censored, our chat isn't the place to be sharing your stand on LGBTQ+</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-01/1625106741-578295-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-01/1625106764-991707-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>This right here,<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-01/1625106788-179658-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nYou're generalizing the whole movement as this news you've seen all over the internet cause you're cool and hip like that. None of these people who raided stores, etc. knew what the movement was about nor even cared, or supported it. They were just taking advantage of the situation. Please sam, after all of these years your brain still hasn't developed? Embarrassing. Keep your opinion to your self or share it somewhere else.</p>\n\n<p>I know, I may have said some controversial shit before, but that was all as a joke, it was satire and ironic and I've made it clear before.</p> \n\n<p>You're calling for more attention than the people in this community who are LGBTQ+, <strong>please just shut the fuck up</strong>. You're worse than the people you keep shitting on about, if you hate an LGBTQ+ person irl, don't share the negativity here, the people who are LGBTQ+ in this community are actually pretty chill. But your close-minded head in your ass can't proccess that. They were supressed for many years, and you know that, for what? Having an opinion on <strong>THEIR OWN</strong> gender? Exactly.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"7"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"743"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"7","attributes":{"username":"Jedrik","displayName":"Jedrik","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/DQfRHtHKGcVT6AZv.png","slug":"Jedrik","joinTime":"2020-07-10T10:17:59+00:00","discussionCount":16,"commentCount":689,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-05-17T18:19:08+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Papi Jedrik — 07/29/2021\nI can't handle this community anymore, it was fun at the start with winterhoax, i'll save you the hassle, i'm resigning\n\nSloth — 07/29/2021\nmy thoughts exactly","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"743","attributes":{"title":"LEFTY TOSSERS","slug":"743-lefty-tossers","isApproved":true}}]}

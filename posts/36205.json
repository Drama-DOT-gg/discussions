Because you were breaking discord tos?? I may own a selfbot but never use it.</p> \n\n<p>I allow gaina to use my account for the times that I am very busy (like right now I am sick so he is replying to most dms) and he just happened to see you using your selfbot.</p>\n\n<p>Async do not offer refunds especially when you break tos. They may offer refunds for 14 days but it was a lot longer than 14 days since you \"purchased\" anything from the hosting provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions, please contact me on discord!</p>\n<ul><li>Dubs#7708</li></ul>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4996"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1244"}}}}]}

This was cancelled, less than 6 hours after purchasing, and as such, the service should have been refunded, without a hour long debate in discord, as per his own rules, and the UK Law.</p>\n\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2943"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"415"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2943","attributes":{"username":"NighMayHigh","displayName":"NighMayHigh","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/NEZH5ehutmn6Rm0k.png","slug":"NighMayHigh","joinTime":"2020-12-01T08:54:15+00:00","discussionCount":4,"commentCount":67,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-11-13T21:39:18+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"415","attributes":{"title":"NickE, MCS Hosting LTD & Over allocating.","slug":"415-nicke-mcs-hosting-ltd-over-allocating","isApproved":true}}]}

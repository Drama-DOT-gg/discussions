JetNode was a legitimate company ran by myself in 2019 and all customers were happy. I don't see how it was a scam at all. Regarding the \"scam reports\", everyone who purchased a dedicated server received a full refund. I've offered to show you PayPal screenshots 100s of times, but you've never accepted the truth. <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/AYS\" class=\"UserMention\">@AYS</a> himself can confirm that all dedicated server customers were refunded.</p>\n\n<p>I do not wish to go into anymore detail as this has been settled for over a year now. You clearly are some sort of clown as you've attempted to hoax Contabo, and now myself for something that happened over a year ago, and wasn't even a scam.</p>\n\n<p>I will not reply to any further comments made on this thread. You can send me a DM if you have anymore concerns.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"57"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"169"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"5075"},{"type":"posts","id":"5076"},{"type":"posts","id":"6284"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"57","attributes":{"username":"MCKingSam","displayName":"MCKingSam","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Z8yMtBEBje96YyBu.png","slug":"MCKingSam","joinTime":"2020-08-01T18:23:42+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":47,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-03-17T00:51:26+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2785","attributes":{"username":"Akash_","displayName":"Akash_","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Akash_"}},{"type":"users","id":"33","attributes":{"username":"Leaf","displayName":"Leaf","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Leaf"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"169","attributes":{"title":"McKingSam - Need I say more?","slug":"169-mckingsam-need-i-say-more","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"5075","attributes":{"number":3,"createdAt":"2021-01-25T01:21:07+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/169/2\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"5074\">MCKingSam</a> cap, where's my refund.

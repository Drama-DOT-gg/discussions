Multy host is nothing but a scam . A good friend of mine 'Sid is Live YT â—¥â–¶_â—€â—¤'#2955 is a bot developer and owner of Jericho and i provide him hosting for that . Here are some stupid messages sent by Rehhann to Sid .<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-13/1623566173-597829-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-13/1623566181-811452-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-13/1623566190-60046-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-13/1623566198-314612-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nThe server is now renamed as Flash host (still no tos tho) and from above i can clearly tell that Rehhann just wanted to get as much money as possible and just flee away . Buying a scam server and redesigning it to make it better , i don't think people are gonna trust it now , even if they do trust a server like that they might get in huge trouble . But my host ( G-HOST ) was accused for no reason . It was my friend so he still trusts me but i don't think these scammers are worth using discord...</p>\n\n\n\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3801"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"548"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3801"},{"type":"users","id":"3802"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"18816"},{"type":"posts","id":"18819"},{"type":"posts","id":"18820"}]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"556"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3801","attributes":{"username":"AlphaKennyBody","displayName":"AlphaKennyBody","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/h2RVd40qpBs57osF.png","slug":"AlphaKennyBody","joinTime":"2021-06-13T06:26:28+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":4,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-07-08T06:17:04+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3802","attributes":{"username":"SidisLiveYT","displayName":"SidisLiveYT","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/bxn2PXt96ZK3XIuy.png","slug":"SidisLiveYT"}},{"type":"users","id":"3453","attributes":{"username":"Yie","displayName":"Yie","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/HliIRPjLfMJCXLdJ.png","slug":"Yie"}},{"type":"users","id":"3804","attributes":{"username":"HarryW","displayName":"HarryW","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"HarryW"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"548","attributes":{"title":"MultyHost and Jaiden #6969 | Unprofessional and direspectful owner","slug":"548-multyhost-and-jaiden-6969-unprofessional-and-direspectful-owner","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"18816","attributes":{"number":52,"createdAt":"2021-06-13T06:54:58+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/548/50\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"18814\">AlphaKennyBody</a> <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-13/1623567246-695183-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nShe agreed to this and yesterday she was threatening to hack Jericho , lol ðŸ¤£</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3801"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"548"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"18819","attributes":{"number":55,"createdAt":"2021-06-13T07:09:52+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/548/50\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"18814\">AlphaKennyBody</a> \"wow your bot has no tos thats illegal\" says the motherfucker that runs hosting illegally ðŸ¤·</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3453"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"548"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"18820","attributes":{"number":56,"createdAt":"2021-06-13T07:25:18+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/548/50\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"18814\">AlphaKennyBody</a> FlashHost has new owners and we are hoping that FlashHost will provide a fresh new start.

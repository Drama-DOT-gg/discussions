But what I found out after was that Leo had gone onto the RolledHost GamePanel and stolen the Client Area, I know I got demoted from rolled during all this (honestly i have no idea why), but I coded more then half the client area and the rest of the RolledHost team coded the coin earning, so this is why I'm mad, there are some other points I would like to address There nodes are really over allocated and a few other things I'm sure my friends will cover lower down in this thread, below are some screenshots with captions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Client Area:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://img.daftscientist.com/FMNZFnOTo1Q\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://img.daftscientist.com/FMNZFnOTo1Q</a> - villagenodes haveing the same client area login page as rolledhost has.<br>\n<a href=\"https://img.daftscientist.com/BFx8EQBl5g0\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://img.daftscientist.com/BFx8EQBl5g0</a> - villagenodes haveing the same dashboard page as rolledhost has.<br>\n<a href=\"https://img.daftscientist.com/iMgEP-UcpJA\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://img.daftscientist.com/iMgEP-UcpJA</a> -  villagenodes haveing the same earn coins page as rolledhost has.<br>\nThis carries on for every single page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overalocation</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://img.daftscientist.com/rWTi66CQINM\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://img.daftscientist.com/rWTi66CQINM</a> - DE1 overalocated.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to add.</p>","editedAt":"2021-03-20T11:10:33+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2913"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2913"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"273"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"9252"},{"type":"posts","id":"35777"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2913","attributes":{"username":"Daftscientist","displayName":"Daftscientist","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/v7gTs2a9sEvYU2cT.png","slug":"Daftscientist","joinTime":"2020-10-26T20:54:58+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":168,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-01-22T00:04:35+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"ArkNodes.com is the best host.","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2784","attributes":{"username":"europa","displayName":"europa","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/oXHOl1l6tlB1Ou4v.png","slug":"europa"}},{"type":"users","id":"4886","attributes":{"username":"GrimS","displayName":"GrimS","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/RDejKEvqigySAFqh.png","slug":"GrimS"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"273","attributes":{"title":"Villagenodes | Stealing and abuse.","slug":"273-villagenodes-stealing-and-abuse","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"9252","attributes":{"number":16,"createdAt":"2021-03-22T00:43:24+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/273/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"9055\">Daftscientist</a> <img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-22/1616373796-852466-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nyour imgs just do this now</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2784"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"273"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"35777","attributes":{"number":44,"createdAt":"2021-11-18T14:44:07+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/273/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"9055\">Daftscientist</a> no more shits now</p>\n\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4886"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"273"}}}}]}

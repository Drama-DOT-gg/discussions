My claim is about their ToS is released but it's invalid, more like a fake ToS.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/985/27\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"28738\">Jamie_</a> Gone quiet <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Jerome\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">@Jerome</a>?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, things are getting busier than before, things for me to do are getting more. By the time of being silent, I also waiting for you SLA and lawsuit to Abdullah (although it seems invalid now). Watching how Dashactyl's staff destroying other people VPS at support channel, the staff didn't get demoted and blame over the user fault for taking the advice given by staff seriously. Sometimes I am impress by your management skill, wonder is colournodes.com is also a mess.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I heard you tested positive, didn't wanna laugh at you but take care. I will go back to the topic and sum things up.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3859"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"985"}}}}]}

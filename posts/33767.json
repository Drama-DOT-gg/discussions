Ayaan the owner of night host is a big scammer reported in most of the servers. He keeps on deleting his accounts to not get caught. He had a fake hosting named guitar host which was using free trials like night host and fooling people. You can refer to this for more info: <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/520-guitarhostxyz-using-free-trials-and-lying-to-their-customers\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://drama.gg/d/520-guitarhostxyz-using-free-trials-and-lying-to-their-customers</a> Now after all his plans got failed he is with a new scam, That is Night Host.</p> \n\n<p>Things You Will Face (From my experiance):<br>\n1) You will loose your bot's files and he will say that is a technical issue! Once again you get fooled. What you can do is only cry, hes not gonna give you anything back.<br>\n2) Your bots or whatever you are hosting, the files gets leaked. He has many bots which he copied from his users.<br>\n3) High risk of privacy, as he logs all your data and passwords in a discord channel. (My friend was an moderator there before) which means all your datas including your IP will be exposed.</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/730023081489203241/904797114062749757/olke.JPG\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nHe even forgot to change names lmao</p>\n\n<p>Refer here for more proofs of losing data reported by their staff itself: <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/993-nighthost-losing-customer-data\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://drama.gg/d/993-nighthost-losing-customer-data</a></p>","editedAt":"2021-11-01T18:26:18+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4779"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4779"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1172"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"4779"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4779","attributes":{"username":"Itz_Me","displayName":"Itz_Me","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/zPo0iVNb2e8weY0E.png","slug":"Itz_Me","joinTime":"2021-11-01T18:01:34+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":3,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-11-01T19:11:57+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1172","attributes":{"title":"NightHost using free trials and fooling people by telling they have a VPS!","slug":"1172-nighthost-using-free-trials-and-fooling-people-by-telling-they-have-a-vps","isApproved":true}}]}

Then you basically successfully started a company.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1286/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"37298\">TheAlex</a> Do they use freenom?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>2 Words. Fuck Freenom.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1286/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"37298\">TheAlex</a> If they use WHMCS, check if the theme is nulled or no.</p> </div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If anyone does not KNOW how to check to see a Valid WHMCS license, it's quite simple actually!<br>\nHead on over to <a href=\"https://www.whmcs.com/members/verifydomain.php\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">this link</a> and put in their WHMCS link, usually it'll either be client.domain.extension, or billing.domain.extension. If its Invalid, then you found a NULLED WHMCS license, chances of that being a scam are very likely in this case. However, WHMCS license checking can be very fucky wucky as well. So use multiple devices with multiple browsers to see if its truely invalid or valid.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1286/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"37298\">TheAlex</a> Do they ask to pay with crypto?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Sometimes I just don't understand why people want to sell with crypto- LIKE-</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1286/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"37298\">TheAlex</a> Can they provide proof of invoices?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes- also another way to determine if they're real or not, however, some people may not like to be comfortable. But thats not an excuse, just hide the personal info like; your name, your address, phonenumber, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If they deny, and you most likely get banned. Then you found a scam host.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Are they indian?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>This doesnt matter what their race, or ethnicity, it goes by what their personality is or whether if they're a jerk.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this comment helps too! &lt;3 ðŸ˜ƒ</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4917"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1286"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4917","attributes":{"username":"Sky","displayName":"Sky","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/cS8vcbRYULJjEZTr.png","slug":"Sky","joinTime":"2021-11-22T18:45:56+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":57,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-02-25T06:17:57+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"In the Clouds :D","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1286","attributes":{"title":"How to not get scammed - The suicidal guide","slug":"1286-how-to-not-get-scammed-the-suicidal-guide","isApproved":true}}]}

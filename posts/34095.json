Which is you, so any argument I've made here is fully warranted. (You also said that its a node designed to see if someone would do it, however per your words its honeypot)</p>\n\n<p>Also you continue to say things were a joke, however you did not make a claim and rebuttal that your ban message did say kys (if you try and make a claim against that your dumb)</p>\n\n<p>Also if you \"just released\" then why have you been around for months? Also we didn't try to buy you, we tried to work with you. You only made these changes when me and Yeetster showed up and talked to you about them. I'm not making any claims that we are better, and at no point did I ever suggest that. However I do have a problem with companies like you making the small guys look bad, because you cause problems in our industry. Your TOS and Privacy Policy are NOT long enough to be considered a true TOS document. You never punished the staff members condoning DOS attacks, nor the one who leaked your password. Also <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Chirag\" class=\"UserMention\">@Chirag</a> so lovingly showed that you use free trials with the full intent of switching again once it runs out. Starting a host requires money, using trials puts your clients data at risk if you can't keep it safe. So if you cannot afford to pay for the nodes, don't start a hosting service</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4777"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1171"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4777","attributes":{"username":"tenzfan","displayName":"tenzfan","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/NmwJk64MDiWT60uc.png","slug":"tenzfan","joinTime":"2021-11-01T13:43:06+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":28,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-06-21T02:06:36+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"Setting the facts straight and exposing companies in my free time :D","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1171","attributes":{"title":"Watch out for Yeet Hosting","slug":"1171-watch-out-for-yeet-hosting","isApproved":true}}]}

First of all this guy and his hosting already has several threads on drama.gg.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-21/1661125731-813673-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>SharkHost, Relefree and Relehost are from the same guy, this hosting was first called Relehost, then Relefree and now it has changed its name to SharkHost.</p>\n\n<p>Well, let's go to what we are interested in, first let's talk about when this hosting was called Relefree.</p> \n\n<p>First, this hosting stole the css style of the login page of my dashboard, I attach proofs where I show it and later he admits it.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-21/1661126074-556469-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-21/1661126078-290795-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-21/1661126103-130975-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-21/1661126123-107952-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nAnd here I'm going to show when he admits that if he was stolen, I helped him with something so I asked him not to use my css.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-21/1661126198-795137-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nAfter that he made us a drama.gg to my hosting, which by the way he deleted it and then I found out that he scammed several people with vps, and I went to ask him about it and he blocked me.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-22/1661126821-284701-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nAfter all that, some time later he literally stole the website from a hosting company called ColourNodes, he literally didn't even delete the css credits.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-22/1661127789-910310-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-22/1661127795-451092-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nAlso, actually and this is new. He copied from the maintenance page of my hosting lol.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-22/1661131670-732119-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-22/1661131679-336099-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I recently found out that their hosting is currently using Ionos Spain's free trial dedicated for their nodes. Basically what he does is hire a dedicated there because the first month they don't charge you, they charge you the following month. But when you hire them you use a card that then blocks it so that when the time comes that ionos wants to charge you they can't do it.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-22/1661129642-361125-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nTranslation of the screenshot: 0 €<br>\nThe invoice amount of 130 € will be charged after one month.</p>\n\n<p>Going back in time, this guy was using Google Cloud Free Trial for his nodes, then he started using Oracle Free Tier and is currently using ionos free dedicated server. Here is a screenshot of an ad he posted on his hosting discord, what a coincidence that the ad was posted a month after he contracted the dedicated hosting.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-22/1661129877-826476-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nusa1.sharkhost.es IONOS SE<br>\nusa2.sharkhost.es IONOS SE<br>\nusa3.sharkhost.es IONOS SE<br>\nusa4.sharkhost.es IONOS SE<br>\nusa5.sharkhost.es IONOS SE<br>\nusa6.sharkhost.es IONOS SE<br>\nusa7.sharkhost.es IONOS SE</p>\n\n<p>And this is not the end, there are too many things missing only now I must go to sleep, so I post this thread and tomorrow I will continue it.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5569"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2013"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"6751"},{"type":"users","id":"6754"},{"type":"users","id":"6816"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1748"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"5569","attributes":{"username":"vainki","displayName":"vainki","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/3yul3zlBJONvP1ws.png","slug":"vainki","joinTime":"2022-02-14T22:55:15+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":11,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-12-11T04:27:49+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"6751","attributes":{"username":"gabote26","displayName":"gabote26","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/7JtJvpdVHYXO8d6Y.png","slug":"gabote26"}},{"type":"users","id":"6754","attributes":{"username":"nashe","displayName":"nashe","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/dth087klHghnBdhw.png","slug":"nashe"}},{"type":"users","id":"6816","attributes":{"username":"El_SrGatito","displayName":"El_SrGatito","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/fs4HBru9rsmnEdTT.png","slug":"El_SrGatito"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2013","attributes":{"title":"SharkHost/ReleFree - The worst hosting in the world.","slug":"2013-sharkhostrelefree-the-worst-hosting-in-the-world","isApproved":true}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1748","attributes":{"userId":6816,"postId":48545,"reactionId":12}}]}

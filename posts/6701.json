After a review of our records, I don't think you ever had access to any of our services and as such, you would not have been able to make a fair judgement or review of the performance of our servers. So I don't understand why you tagged this thread with \"Hilarious Performance\".</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3194"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"210"}}}}]}

He clearly told you to wait until Plactrix is on to review the situation. However, it's shown that you got extremely angry when you were told to wait. Your files were all still safe, yet you still got angry. If an abusive staff member gave you a free VPS, you can't expect to keep it. You're lucky that the VPS was only suspended, and not deleted fully. Also, QuackHost is terrible and you're a skid. You shouldn't be relying on a free VPS anyway.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"57"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"129"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"4045"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"57","attributes":{"username":"MCKingSam","displayName":"MCKingSam","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/Z8yMtBEBje96YyBu.png","slug":"MCKingSam","joinTime":"2020-08-01T18:23:42+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":47,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-03-17T00:51:26+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2923","attributes":{"username":"JackThePug","displayName":"JackThePug","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/CLJKfZLC1HvA9nYY.png","slug":"JackThePug"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"129","attributes":{"title":"ghosty.host | deleted the \"free vps\" the ex management team gave.","slug":"129-ghostyhost-deleted-the-free-vps-the-ex-management-team-gave","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"4045","attributes":{"number":15,"createdAt":"2020-11-10T22:43:22+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/129/13\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"4037\">MCKingSam</a></p> \n\n<p>As we have stated multiple times, its not even the vps we want back, we want our files back. I was told by ryder several times that he wouldnt get my data back, Im sure he knew, that we owned the files and owned the vps. What we are angry about is the fact that he just is refusing to give our files back, he knows we owned it, there is no reason not to give us our data back...</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2923"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"129"}}}}]}

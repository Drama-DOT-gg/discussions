Just last night (May 4th), they posted an announcement with two emails they had the domain censored out, however, they did something like thisisarandomemail@#####.com, so I easily found out that it was a gmail domain. I told one of the staff that it was very VERY insecure to do that. They then deleted my message, so I made a new one saying that I'll be collecting data on them for, well, this post. They decided to ban me. $MoneyBoi$#0999 is the owner. LeetNodes used to be known as SakuraNodes are something.</p> \n\n<p>Anyways, like I said in the beginning, not here to cause a bullshit fight, just here to let you know that LeetNodes is very very insecure, and you shouldn't use them.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2865"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"454"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"13345"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2865","attributes":{"username":"TheMGDEV","displayName":"TheMGDEV","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/VRjtji7zYLDyezNw.png","slug":"TheMGDEV","joinTime":"2020-10-06T06:17:30+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":20,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-05-17T02:54:26+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3514","attributes":{"username":"Knifeworm","displayName":"Knifeworm","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/ujheu50rj4vO4iWh.png","slug":"Knifeworm"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"454","attributes":{"title":"LeetNodes, Leaking Emails.","slug":"454-leetnodes-leaking-emails","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"13345","attributes":{"number":2,"createdAt":"2021-05-05T15:26:53+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/454/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"13344\">TheMGDEV</a> Hello TheMGDEV i would like to inform you if u actully looked at the email it was so########@#####.c## so if u think we would acctually expose an email its self then you are wrong.</p>\n\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3514"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"454"}}}}]}

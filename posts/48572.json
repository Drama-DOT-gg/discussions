If they paid there would be no reason to delete the machines, a company does not delete your services just because. And the evidence of the copy of the CSS is above, it is literally the same variable.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5569"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2013"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"48574","attributes":{"number":9,"createdAt":"2022-08-24T22:34:46+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2013/7\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"48572\">Pelotudo_</a> When i join you \"hosting\" one member group said. \"We pay or nodes, They are down because a maintenance.\" I told him the real reason after that the ban me if you pay your nodes then why you are banning me from your main hosting?<br>\nThats Suspicious</p>\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3694"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2013"}}}}]}

I personally think that the owner needs to learn how to run a company better he's really strange and aggressive most of the time. He lies to customers plenty and fails to provide simple information etc. If I tell much more my identity will be revealed but overall I'd just use a different company.. I'll try to provide as much as I can but for now what I can say is limited for privacy reasons.</p>\n\n<p>I do feel that <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/154/54\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"4529\">Detective_Alpha</a> should have been given a warning of some sort instead of immediately resorting to demoting him but Alpha has done a lot of bad things such as slandering other companies and stealing assets and arguing with other company owners for no reason.</p>\n\n<p>Jay has also slandered other company names for using equal hardware to them and is an odd person overall.</p>\n\n<p>Tilted Hosting is no better though, they've had a pretty bad background in general. For your safety, please just stay far away from both Navo Hosting and Tilted Hosting.</p>","editedAt":"2021-01-21T01:34:31+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3021"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3021"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"154"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"3016"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"4599"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3021","attributes":{"username":"WockySlush","displayName":"WockySlush","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/lbsO9BM9wW73JCfF.png","slug":"WockySlush","joinTime":"2021-01-21T01:24:23+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":50,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-01-25T13:27:55+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3016","attributes":{"username":"Tilted","displayName":"Tilted","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/YsVFhDzJK7ZMtb6t.png","slug":"Tilted"}},{"type":"users","id":"2993","attributes":{"username":"Detective_Alpha","displayName":"Detective_Alpha","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Detective_Alpha"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"154","attributes":{"title":"NavoHosting-Scammers-Griefers-TiltedHost Resellers","slug":"154-navohosting-scammers-griefers-tiltedhost-resellers","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"4599","attributes":{"number":92,"createdAt":"2021-01-21T09:25:38+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/154/84\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"4586\">WockySlush</a> I didnt steal assets ,but alr</p> "},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2993"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"154"}}}}]}

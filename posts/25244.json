Some more than others (Bonjour my baguette), Just because you don't like the fact someone opened a thread to call out your company doesn't give you the excuse to open another thread attempting to call them out because you don't think their view is right. If a thread has incorrect information, request one of the moderators to review the thread, they will then check the information out and change its status if it deserves changing.</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3416"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"906"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"25250"},{"type":"posts","id":"25261"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3416","attributes":{"username":"Cain","displayName":"Cain","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/xwjaqVpRZualQYHr.png","slug":"Cain","joinTime":"2021-04-20T11:33:57+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":30,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-11T19:40:34+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"4147","attributes":{"username":"Dev_X","displayName":"Dev_X","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/2emsbcMZGMbjwaQa.png","slug":"Dev_X"}},{"type":"users","id":"3951","attributes":{"username":"Bartosz1","displayName":"Bartosz1","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/g2ynzslY8MawJa5E.png","slug":"Bartosz1"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"906","attributes":{"title":"xshadow, bartosz1, blackkitten","slug":"906-xshadow-bartosz1-blackkitten","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"25250","attributes":{"number":58,"createdAt":"2021-08-21T15:44:33+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/906/55\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25244\">Cain</a> literally i didnt open this thread cuz of the other thead tf are u talking bout i never said that?</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4147"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"906"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"25261","attributes":{"number":68,"createdAt":"2021-08-21T19:14:31+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/906/55\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25244\">Cain</a> <br>\nI just got flashbacks when I was testing some bot you were making with you haha<br>\nAnd yeah I agree this thread is pointless <br>\nDev X: \"fuck, another guy on their side\" (joke)</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3951"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"906"}}}}]}

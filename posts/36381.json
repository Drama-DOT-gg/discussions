Can you send some screenshots of me accusing you of the things mentioned?</p>\n\n<p>The button is blocked because we have had issues with a group of people using stolen credit cards and PayPal accounts. We do not support this activity, and work with the owners and banks involved to make sure they get their money back. We keep all account data as it includes logs of actions performed and IP addresses involved. This helps us block these fraudulent orders.</p>\n\n<p>Also what were you trying to delete? The fake address you used to sign up? Because that's what you told me in DM's. I forgot we implemented that, and Marcos obviously was not aware of the situation. If you want your account deleted just message me. I really have no problem deleting your account with your fake address and Fortnite related email.</p>\n\n<p>Grow up.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3662"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"909"}}}}]}

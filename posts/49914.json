Yeahh forcing to use discord for support is kinda pain, both for the customers and the staff. Because many staff use their main account for the moderation, they tend to get pestered by customers even in their DMs, putting unnecessary pressure on staff to answer, most staff would just ignore, making it even worse as that worsens the  customer's perception of the support quality. Online forums and/or tickets (<em>cough</em> even the default WHMCS ones <em>cough</em>) are often a way better alternative, and look more professional.</p>\n\n<p>Training support staff is also pretty important, sometimes maybe even investing in getting proper support staff that aren't 'voluntary staff' (<em>cough</em> free labour <em>cough</em>). Not a knock against any hosting in particular, but a lot of the times the untrained volunteer staff (that are only there because they want to help in their free time and don't actually already know about common issues and how to resolve them) tend to be a major factor why someone would complain about the poor support quality.</p>\n\n<p>Can't really talk much bout not being cliche considering my host is also based off of pterodactyl, but yeah, even if you aren't a big frontend guy like me, you can definitely at least make custom eggs like I did for my host, its not too hard to learn either (trust me blockhead approved üëçÔ∏è ). Don't be afraid to take a leap and try modify stuff yourself (as long as you do it in a test environment), it actually gets fun building custom solutions after a while. Not only does it help you make more modifications and quick adjustments to enhance user experience, it also makes it look as if you aren't some rand shithost that;s gonna go down in like 2 days anyways.</p>\n\n<p><del>Also yeah just dont use nulled stuff if u dont wanna become a meme overnight</del></p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2869"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"2117"}},"likes":{"data":[{"type":"users","id":"2977"},{"type":"users","id":"3377"},{"type":"users","id":"7004"}]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1794"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2869","attributes":{"username":"flaxeneel2","displayName":"flaxeneel2","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"flaxeneel2","joinTime":"2020-10-08T14:31:42+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":13,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-09-17T17:40:42+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2977","attributes":{"username":"Two","displayName":"Two","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Two"}},{"type":"users","id":"3377","attributes":{"username":"Korbs","displayName":"Korbs","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/CUD5vV2bKVwuF8sd.png","slug":"Korbs"}},{"type":"users","id":"7004","attributes":{"username":"Young","displayName":"Young","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/jjOfAwYfyJgg1Yl7.png","slug":"Young"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"2117","attributes":{"title":"I'm Sick of Hositng Companies and This Needs to be Taken Care of","slug":"2117-im-sick-of-hositng-companies-and-this-needs-to-be-taken-care-of","isApproved":true}},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"1794","attributes":{"userId":3377,"postId":49914,"reactionId":16}}]}

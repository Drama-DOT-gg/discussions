You could reply in the other discords where you were in tho. We've disabled your contact with us due to that email, and multiple refusals to go to your clientarea to make support requests. We do not feel like Discord is a perfect place to share those kinds of details on, and are working hard on our clientarea to make it a easy experience for the user. The excuses you gave for not wanting to go to our clientarea to make support requests were actually very bad: \"I dont want to leak the static ip of my wework office\" and \"i dont feel like it\". No, if you want us to refund or be official whilst saying \"we're going to sue you\" but wanting to handle things via discord is not the case in here. We do colocate with FirstLight (NET) with their FIOS network, and that's why the IPs might be showing up as residential. We're moving away soon to a Corespace Datacenter in New York with a own asn and more network capacity as Verizon simply doesn't offer us enough space to grow. We did not refuse your refund, we only asked you to make a ticket for it in our clientarea, what you did actually refuse a few times. We also changed our passwords to be more secure in the future, and we are active working on new automatic provisioning with so automatic passwords and management to make it more easier for our customers. We also decided to remove the possible copyrighted hero banner from our website. The fact that you can never be professional, screaming at other hosts / kids / people that they are bad whilst you can't even pay your own customers their refunds and employee's is a big thing to say so. We also shouldn't be called poor whilst having working owned hardware who can reach to it's max capacity not speaking about the facts that your RAM failed. We're disappointed with the service you might have experienced from us, and we're always searching for a solution. About our registration with Stripe, this has been resolved and \"Inc.\" is removed from our creditcard statements until further notice. If you would like your refund to be made please create a ticket or e-mail us at <a href=\"mailto:support@proxala.io\">support@proxala.io</a> / <a href=\"mailto:hello@proxala.io\">hello@proxala.io</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\nAspect</p>","editedAt":"2021-07-10T14:42:13+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3943"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3943"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"787"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"21241"},{"type":"posts","id":"21243"}]},"reactions":{"data":[{"type":"post_reactions","id":"697"},{"type":"post_reactions","id":"698"}]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3943","attributes":{"username":"Aspect","displayName":"Aspect","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/wmcd8eCDgvAl1Hok.png","slug":"Aspect","joinTime":"2021-07-08T15:54:16+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":5,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-07-28T00:28:42+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":"ELzkb5jXQwbdXROA.jpg","cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2943","attributes":{"username":"NighMayHigh","displayName":"NighMayHigh","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/NEZH5ehutmn6Rm0k.png","slug":"NighMayHigh"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"787","attributes":{"title":"Proxala: Refusing Refunds, Suspending Services, Home Hosting","slug":"787-proxala-refusing-refunds-suspending-services-home-hosting","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"21241","attributes":{"number":4,"createdAt":"2021-07-10T14:48:18+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/787/3\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"21240\">Aspect</a></p> \n\n<p>'claiming' I was asleep?</p>\n\n<p>No, i was asleep.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, ive already sent you multiple refund requests, that you ignored. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625928496-375407-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2943"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"787"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"21243","attributes":{"number":6,"createdAt":"2021-07-10T14:52:37+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/787/3\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"21240\">Aspect</a> you were \"claiming\" you were asleep.

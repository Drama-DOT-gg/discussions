The notion that people shouldn't be able to learn is so unbelievably and unequivocally unhinged. You're causing havoc for no reason - to people that don't deserve it. This user did nothing to you, yet you found it fit to tell someone to nuke a server that they've been working on. That's a bit fucked up.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"4665"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"31520"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"4665","attributes":{"username":"Music4lity","displayName":"Music4lity","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/VKNvXCX4nd5U1eBv.png","slug":"Music4lity","joinTime":"2021-10-19T13:43:16+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":40,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-10-20T14:50:16+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1118","attributes":{"title":"Dashactyl Support","slug":"1118-dashactyl-support","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"31520","attributes":{"number":38,"createdAt":"2021-10-19T14:43:59+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1118/36\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"31515\">Music4lity</a> Why are you starting a host if you have no clue? I admit, it has gone a bit too far with the nuking and they have all been told to stop with no exceptions, but you should atleast have the smallest slice of knowledge of linux to have to install dashactyl like starting a host.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}}}}]}

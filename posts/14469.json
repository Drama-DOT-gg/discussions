Over the years, it has been amended several times, most recently in 2008, to cover a broad range of conduct far beyond its original intent. The CFAA prohibits intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or in excess of authorization, but fails to define what “without authorization” means. With harsh penalty schemes and malleable provisions, it has become a tool ripe for abuse and use against nearly every aspect of computer activity.</strong></p>\n\n<p>where?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/it-legislation/28174/what-is-the-computer-misuse-act\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Computer Misuse Act (UK)</a></p>\n\n<p>where? where? and where?</p>","editedAt":"2021-05-13T07:21:19+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3379"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3379"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"485"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3379","attributes":{"username":"L4db","displayName":"L4db","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"L4db","joinTime":"2021-04-13T01:31:08+00:00","discussionCount":3,"commentCount":63,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-07-15T13:27:01+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"your critic buddy, also any words of wisdom?","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"485","attributes":{"title":"PolarNodes - Reselling Contabo, Fake Company Registration, Overallocating","slug":"485-polarnodes-reselling-contabo-fake-company-registration-overallocating","isApproved":true}}]}

We do not need to be a registered company because we make less than 12K a year and you also tried threatening to DDOS us many times and you have also threatened me to buy a VPS for you many times when you said couldnâ€™t afford a VPS at that time I fell for it and kept buying you VPS's but soon I found out you used me for VPS's and didnâ€™t like me at all.! You were also incredibly homophobic and racist saying the N word and the F slur which many people found incredibly offensive. You also threatened to dox me many times before. You also called us skids because we were using Pterodactyl Panel and you demanded that you made our own panel. A new panel is not in the works but our aim is to customise pterodactyl and with the Discord server again I did not know it was violating the Discord Rules and if I knew it was now I would not of bought the discord server.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3804"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"709"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"22390","attributes":{"number":32,"createdAt":"2021-07-23T09:14:06+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/709/30\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"22120\">Xpert</a> Harry's mostly covered everything here, i just want to talk about you attempting to <strong>DDOS</strong> <strong>US</strong></p>\n\n<p>So you tried to bring up old drama then you said you can \"deface our website forever\" <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-23/1627031239-247681-screenshot-20210723-095626-discord.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Then we have</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-23/1627031268-93580-unknown-13.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>&amp; on your other account your saying we used \"premade software\" ðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤¨</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-23/1627031364-150852-screenshot-20210723-100848-discord.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Then you getting accused of saying the N Word <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-23/1627031543-509819-image0-1.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>So making loads of drama for no reason is quite pathetic.</p> \n\n\n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3845"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"709"}}}}]}

He mentioned his Minecraft server, when I looked at its host I found out that it was Fallout Hosting (<a href=\"https://fallout-hosting.com/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://fallout-hosting.com/</a>). After looking at the plans, I thought its $1/GB of RAM as they NEVER mentioned wheather its RAM or disk that they are offering for $1/GB. They did not even mention the amount of RAM or the amount of CPU cores that they provide you with. After talking to my customer a bit more, I found out that it was $1/GB of disk (<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826128126479564810/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826128126479564810/unknown.png</a>). Those guys are literally scamming kids with $1/GB of disk for a Minecraft server. Its one of the most ridiculous things I have stumbled upon in a while. I am not really sure if it fits in here though. Most of the names have been cut out from the screenies for the privacy of our customers. All the proof that I did not give in screenies can be found on their website (<a href=\"https://fallout-hosting.com/minecraft-hosting\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://fallout-hosting.com/minecraft-hosting</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Turns out, they offer $1/GB of RAM. Still, does it quality since they dont mention other things?</p>","editedAt":"2021-03-29T16:38:15+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3290"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3290"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"329"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3290","attributes":{"username":"MysteriousK","displayName":"MysteriousK","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/78rodXLw9hML6nqB.png","slug":"MysteriousK","joinTime":"2021-03-29T15:52:55+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":9,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-04-02T11:15:17+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"329","attributes":{"title":"Hosting providing disk for $1/GB.

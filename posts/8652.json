We use multiple providers ranging from startups to leading companies in the industry. <br>\nSecondly:<br>\nWe have a TOS. I made a mistake when speaking to you, where I directed you to the wrong link - I apologise for that, but the terms have been active this whole time.<br>\nThirdly:<br>\n£1/GB for 24/7 Minecraft hosting on AMD EPYC CPU's with unlimited SSD storage is not in any way a bad price. We need to make profit while providing a good price and customer experience, which is why our prices are as they are. They are subject to change, on deals and such.<br>\nFourthly:<br>\nWe do not provide free services. When you beg us repetitively for free servers when we explicitly are paid-only, you're pushing my limits. I'm going to be annoyed if it's the 50th time you've asked - ESPECIALLY as you have your own hosting service with servers!</p>\n\n<p>Also, some smaller points you made:<br>\nWe have an automatic system in place to assign the role. <br>\nWe have stated that previous providers were not up to Dijx standard, so we no longer use those providers. We want the end user to have the best experience possible and this is an example of the changes we have made to improve customer service.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know what you're trying to achieve by doing this - but reply if you wish to contradict my statement.</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3183"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"268"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3183","attributes":{"username":"JexUK","displayName":"JexUK","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"JexUK","joinTime":"2021-03-07T21:58:20+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":83,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2021-04-03T21:43:54+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"I hate to be political but pineapple goes on pizza ","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"268","attributes":{"title":"https://dijxcloud.com/ // https://dijxcloud.xyz/ | £1 a GB RAM host. | No tos","slug":"268-httpsdijxcloudcom-httpsdijxcloudxyz-1-a-gb-ram-host-no-tos","isApproved":true}}]}

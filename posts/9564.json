We should be complaining about the whole host because they were using the node that was obtained illegally. Also they kept snip nip as a member of the staff team I think they even went and gave him a promotion. Also have you seen the privacy policy? Because that stuff is just not valid. How can you even try and defend this host?</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2839"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"293"}}}}]}

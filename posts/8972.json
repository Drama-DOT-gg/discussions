The purpose of him doing <em>all of this</em> is to, as you probably already know, gather attention, which you are feeding him just by talking about it. I'd suggest ignoring him being emo, and someday he'll come to terms with the fact that him broadcasting his fake depression to thousands of people in his Discord server probably isn't the best of ideas, in a community perspective, but who knows with this kid, he is so indecisive and pretentious it is unbelievable. Changing names, creating hosts, lying about the simplest of things, bragging to thousands of people about his \"e-relationship\".<br>\nstop<br>\nEither run your shitty host(s) like you're doing right now, and it'll end up the deep end in a not very long amount of time. You're highly unprofessional and incapable to do anything right.

Mine works fine and so does every body elses.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/16\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25331\">abdullah</a> I explained this to you</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, you didn't. And even if you wanted to try to \"prove\" this, you deleted every message in our DMs.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/16\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25331\">abdullah</a> Also, the TrustPilot reviews have no evidence behind them</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Apart from all the screenshots I have?</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/16\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25331\">abdullah</a> or just people like you, who have never even tried the services but still find the audacity to leave 1-star reviews on other peoples' hard work.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>\"never tried the services\" - I think me and <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Two\" class=\"UserMention\">@Two</a> and Daft can agree that when we used you for crystalhost, we had constant lagg with only a couple servers on the node, slow internet speeds (Panel proves that) and constant downtime.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/16\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25331\">abdullah</a> on your broken company</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Broken company? ok</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/16\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25331\">abdullah</a> just shows why it hasn't taken off.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Well we are making our money back and making profit. So I don't actually mind. Besides, I enjoy running colournodes and the comunity it has.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/16\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25331\">abdullah</a> ColourNodes is just a WinterHoax literally, and lies about legal registration, etc.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Look at every single other post about us, they were all proven wrong. And lying about registration? Just because you don't understand what a Sole Trader is, doesn't mean like you have to pretend like it doesn't exist.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/16\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25331\">abdullah</a> The fact that ColourNodes management is sitting on drama.gg all day instead of fixing their broken servers and setup should show you guys how good their services actually are, and how much they care about their customers.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>We care about our customers a lot. We give a lot of downtime credit when needed and credit when something happens that wasn't the customers fault. We have a lot of happy customers thank you.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/16\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25331\">abdullah</a> I am deleting my messages because I want to stop being taken out of context.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>You weren't taken out of context, you are just so butt hurt that me and other people are telling the world what you are doing and have done.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/16\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25331\">abdullah</a> father genuinely tried to take me to court and get me arrested for firing you from my company?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Pardon? Even if he tried, he has no clue how to. I am gonna be real here.

Making this post? You are right. But it will have a lot of value to your customers whos packets you are sniffing and the people who you have threatened to DDoS.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"909"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"25449"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2958","attributes":{"username":"Jamie_","displayName":"Jamie_","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/mqUWhN8ZxnAg68p0.png","slug":"Jamie_","joinTime":"2020-12-13T20:34:09+00:00","discussionCount":8,"commentCount":425,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-25T17:08:00+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2977","attributes":{"username":"Two","displayName":"Two","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"Two"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"909","attributes":{"title":"abdullah.#0001 | DDoSer | Threatening to DOX | Lots of downtime on company","slug":"909-abdullah0001-ddoser-threatening-to-dox-lots-of-downtime-on-company","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"25449","attributes":{"number":120,"createdAt":"2021-08-22T18:28:21+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/909/17\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"25332\">Jamie_</a> \"never tried the services\" - I think me and <a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Two\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">@Two</a> and Daft can agree that when we used you for crystalhost, we had constant lagg with only a couple servers on the node, slow internet speeds (Panel proves that) and constant downtime.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>it wasn't slow but it kept failing to communicate with discord/etc sometimes, it was annoying<br>\nservers werent that bad</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2977"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"909"}}}}]}

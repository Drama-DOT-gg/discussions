Like I said before, they have been told to stop and I haven't taken a look at the dashactyl server for so long as I have been busy with other stuff. I shouldn't have to sit each staff member down and tell them how naughty they are!? You have an issue with them, DM me for gods sake, don't bitch about it in a drama.gg thread.</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2958"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1118"}}}}]}

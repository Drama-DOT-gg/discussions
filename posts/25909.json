Background is that I bought a Ryzen 7 3700X with 1 year of power-on time and a B450 motherboard for $150 from one of their used hardware sales. After I paid it by credit card, he basically stopped responding in DMs so I opened a ticket, where he still didn't respond. The date right now is 27th August, 2021, and I haven't received any CPU or motherboard at either address provided. He also agrees into a refund later on (which was never issued, and no screenshots were provided for anything) implying that he knew that the CPU was never sent. Anyways, I don't want to influence you too much, here is our conversation and proof of payment:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-27/1630076501-7232-discord-trnecfwxve.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-27/1630076558-535546-discord-8huwlfmzpn.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-27/1630076574-316912-discord-7qopm3bgni.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-27/1630076582-501853-discord-mmmb5dcmj1.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-27/1630076587-686439-discord-uquj2xfwqs.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-27/1630076593-286628-discord-l7fxllkkvr.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-27/1630076597-525335-728-543-max.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>I've blurred the addresses for obvious reasons.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/NighMayHigh\" class=\"UserMention\">@NighMayHigh</a> Just stop scamming people for their money, people work so hard for every dollar, and not for you to steal it...</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3662"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"717"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3662","attributes":{"username":"abdullah","displayName":"abdullah","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/CeagHWLlW1guFVRp.png","slug":"abdullah","joinTime":"2021-05-19T20:01:20+00:00","discussionCount":0,"commentCount":32,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-09-11T22:28:29+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"717","attributes":{"title":"System413 - Waited over a month for a refund, never received.","slug":"717-system413-waited-over-a-month-for-a-refund-never-received","isApproved":true}}]}

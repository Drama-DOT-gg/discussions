I have my entire life edited files the wrong way, thank god server.pro is here to save me. With all fairness, however, their file manager and text editor are terrible. They lack any keyboard controls, e.g. ctrl+s to save the file <code>esc</code> to close it. Navigating files is a nightmare. You can't see the full path you are browsing but only the name of the parent directory. To get back to an upper directory you need click multiple times the parent folder.<br>\nI am a little concerned about this comma but I'll just pretend I don't see it. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-20/1621528110-571986-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-20/1621528184-277401-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nAh ye thanks for giving me a subdomain for free, it usually costs a lot of money. Thank you. But at least don't lie to me about owning it.

And plans in theri host are like this \"i9 nodes are budget and intel xeon are premium lol\"<br>\nPicture 1 - <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-28/1622233625-536787-1.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nAlso when i asked where is tos and privacy, their manager responded \" may i know why does this concern you, we arent even scamming people\" - lol like they what should they do scam people tf lol.<br>\nPicture 2 -<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-28/1622233779-330019-2.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nAnd shams(owner) also says legal documents arent important<br>\nPicture 3 - <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-28/1622233852-514993-3.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nLater i asked for proof that he has i9 nodes<br>\nPicture 4 - <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-28/1622233935-210914-4.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nPicture 5 - <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-28/1622233987-698145-5.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nThen i wanted to kind of trick him to show me proof of having i9 nodes so i said if he shows me that i will buy server lol<br>\nPicture 6 - <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-28/1622234060-13640-6.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nThen he said he will show me in pterodactly panel, which you cant show any proof of specification of nodes<br>\nPicture 7 - <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-28/1622234143-382362-7.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>After that i stopped screenshoting, but i was trying to get him to show me real proof of having i9 nodes.<br>\nAnd then i got banned for no reason, their reason was probably : \"asking stupid questions\" lol<br>\nIm 99% sure they use velocitynode.net vps budget plan, because shams wanted to purchase that for his old host.</p>\n\n<p>So we can all agree that having a paid or free host on free domain is retarded, and having no privacy policy or tos, and lying about having good nodes.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment there is a new owner ThunderX, i think he will fix host, so dont hate on him.</p>\n\n<p>Links OTA Host<br>\nDiscord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/X4uSv84hvD\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.gg/X4uSv84hvD</a> (if they delete link let me know)<br>\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://otahosting.ga\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://otahosting.ga</a> - redirects to panel<br>\nPanel:  <a href=\"https://panel.otahosting.ga\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://panel.otahosting.ga</a> <br>\nFor anymore questions reply here or dm me on discord \"RumGuru#8155\"<br>\nThanks!</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3257"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"578"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"17253"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3257","attributes":{"username":"RumGuru","displayName":"RumGuru","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/LfdbF5Ex7oM05L6h.png","slug":"RumGuru","joinTime":"2021-03-25T07:43:10+00:00","discussionCount":6,"commentCount":465,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-03-20T12:49:12+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"3027","attributes":{"username":"AlphaDarky","displayName":"AlphaDarky","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"AlphaDarky"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"578","attributes":{"title":"OTA - Hosting - ShamsPlays#2200/no tos&pp/lying about nodes/free domain.","slug":"578-ota-hosting-shamsplays2200no-tospplying-about-nodesfree-domain","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"17253","attributes":{"number":50,"createdAt":"2021-05-29T14:39:23+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/578/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"17134\">RumGuru</a> Also when i asked where is tos and privacy, their manager responded \" may i know why does this concern you, we arent even scamming people\" - lol like they what should they do scam people tf lol.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSs_FoS8HxQyYMz_hdVx0_DRD0Z1CK33JFC7VuENBs4ZmlPB01LO2OhubhYHhgcw6DWJEo__KIVxEJb/pub\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSs_FoS8HxQyYMz_hdVx0_DRD0Z1CK33JFC7VuENBs4ZmlPB01LO2OhubhYHhgcw6DWJEo__KIVxEJb/pub</a></p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3027"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"578"}}}}]}

Things have changed, I would like to appologize to our clients about the data loss, and the frustration, and anger. I would also like to say that all things ran by Rocket should not be trusted, this includes, the many host(s) that he runs such as Ark Hosting, Ice Hosting, and others, I would also like to say be careful with the data you give him. According to his Privacy Policy, he can sell your data with in a merge, or what ever. Please be considerate on which host you use.</p> \n\n<p>Thank you so much, Edward Snowden#2417</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3020"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"83"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3020","attributes":{"username":"EdwardSnowde","displayName":"EdwardSnowde","avatarUrl":null,"slug":"EdwardSnowde","joinTime":"2021-01-20T22:18:58+00:00","discussionCount":2,"commentCount":123,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-04-08T22:52:21+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"83","attributes":{"title":"SnowyHosting, BombHosting & OrbitNodes |  Rectrox/RoseyMC","slug":"83-snowyhosting-bombhosting-orbitnodes-rectroxroseymc","isApproved":true}}]}

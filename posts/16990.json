I'm on Falix From so long when it had like 500 members. It used to be really good but now since there are like 80k+ users. The nodes are not enough and they are just overloaded no matter how much ram or core you have will still lag if the node gets overloaded. Maybe sometimes when most of the server goes offline it may not lag but 90% of the time it does. Leave java server aside which uses a lot of resources even one of the lowest resources eater PocketMine-MP lags too. It's because of Overload in nodes cuz of over allocation. They just need more nodes.<br>\nAnd this is the truth</p>","editedAt":"2021-05-28T04:15:23+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2801"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2801"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"16993"},{"type":"posts","id":"16999"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2801","attributes":{"username":"DeadBush","displayName":"DeadBush","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/XbjcjyJPwRXjAX5J.png","slug":"DeadBush","joinTime":"2020-09-13T20:26:47+00:00","discussionCount":16,"commentCount":295,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-10-07T06:26:03+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":"I'm DeadBush","canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"users","id":"2947","attributes":{"username":"Mocab","displayName":"Mocab","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/qbgHP4sCPHQryfHb.png","slug":"Mocab"}},{"type":"users","id":"3726","attributes":{"username":"SirBlob","displayName":"SirBlob","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/qKaVNfIVNfKGvuvt.png","slug":"SirBlob"}},{"type":"discussions","id":"34","attributes":{"title":"Lamaker/ItzAwesome/Lily/Pamar | FalixNodes/Falix.gg & PrimeSRV","slug":"34-lamakeritzawesomelilypamar-falixnodesfalixgg-primesrv","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"16993","attributes":{"number":1131,"createdAt":"2021-05-28T04:17:36+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/34/1128\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"16990\">DeadBush</a> the problem is there are some abusers, and they wont give up. if they go away most of the problems will be solved</p>"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2947"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}},{"type":"posts","id":"16999","attributes":{"number":1137,"createdAt":"2021-05-28T04:20:07+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/34/1128\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"16990\">DeadBush</a> Yo friendly Fire, I do see your point about node overload tho . . .</p> \n"},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3726"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"34"}}}}]}

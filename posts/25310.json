To which you began insulting myself, my company, and my staff, both in DMs, and in our, and drama.gg's discord. I do not understand the reason for this, but you complain that we refund you as soon as we get stock, this was your request, we were prepared, and were more than able to deliver the order by the quoted time, however you continued complaining.</p> \n\n<p>In all honesty, i dont understand what you want from us, you asked for a refund, we agreed to provide it and have begun taking steps to issue it, so what is the issue here?</p>\n","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"2943"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"717"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"2943","attributes":{"username":"NighMayHigh","displayName":"NighMayHigh","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/NEZH5ehutmn6Rm0k.png","slug":"NighMayHigh","joinTime":"2020-12-01T08:54:15+00:00","discussionCount":4,"commentCount":67,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-11-13T21:39:18+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"717","attributes":{"title":"System413 - Waited over a month for a refund, never received.","slug":"717-system413-waited-over-a-month-for-a-refund-never-received","isApproved":true}}]}

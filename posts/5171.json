Now he knows his host has nothing to do with our server so he kept on saying I participated in illegal activity and all other staff believed it and he wanted owner so I gave him owner and left to avoid drama then after sometime I try to go back and then I find out he has banned me which deleted a 3000 words explanation I left in staff announcement and he also deleted his ticket. And now when I am properly talking to him and disproving his lies about me participating in \"illegal activities\" he literally said \"I never, I'm busy with other aruguments brb\" and hasn't replied for like 45 minutes now.</p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"105"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"154"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"105","attributes":{"username":"AbisGamer","displayName":"AbisGamer","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/r3CIX0CHVOcDltkB.png","slug":"AbisGamer","joinTime":"2020-08-26T22:14:14+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":50,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-06-08T11:34:28+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"154","attributes":{"title":"NavoHosting-Scammers-Griefers-TiltedHost Resellers","slug":"154-navohosting-scammers-griefers-tiltedhost-resellers","isApproved":true}}]}

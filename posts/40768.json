Firstly the deals they promote on their website are unbelievable.

So I went to privacy.com and made a card with a balance of 0$ and tried out their 3 month trial</p> \n\n<p>And you know what happened? They tried to charge that card of so many amounts, firstly they tried 5$ then 10$ then 100$ then 1000$ and even more. It's like they were trying to trick poor people into loosing all their life savings!</p>\n\n<p>This isn't correct, you guys can try it out on a privacy or prepaid card and see what happens. Or just select the bank transfer option. Let me know if they actually try the same thing</p>","editedAt":"2022-01-16T09:38:29+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5286"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"5286"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1397"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[{"type":"posts","id":"41530"}]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"5286","attributes":{"username":"Velox","displayName":"Velox","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/0F4kbzLXFvXOhrGv.png","slug":"Velox","joinTime":"2022-01-16T09:31:13+00:00","discussionCount":1,"commentCount":5,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-18T18:41:36+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"1397","attributes":{"title":"VeloVPS.cf SCAM","slug":"1397-velovpscf-scam","isApproved":true}},{"type":"posts","id":"41530","attributes":{"number":16,"createdAt":"2022-01-21T03:24:31+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1397/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"40768\">Velox</a> false info</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1397/1\" class=\"PostMention\" data-id=\"40768\">Velox</a> They tried to charge that card of so many amounts, firstly they tried 5$ then 10$ then 100$ then 1000$ and even more.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>why would they start from the smallest to a higher number lmao? if so they would just stop at $5 cus the card has $0, they probs would start with a higher number then go lower lmfao</p>"},"relationships":{"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"1397"}}}}]}

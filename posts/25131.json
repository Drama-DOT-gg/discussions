So today I was searching through self-advertisement channels on Discord until I found this host called \"FoxyNodes\", I saw it as interesting, so I decided to join. I checked their main site, and it was a Freenom domain. ( <a href=\"https://foxynodes.ml\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://foxynodes.ml</a> )</p>\n\n<p>I also checked their entire site, but never found something about ToS/Privacy Policy, and I knew they were operating for what I saw in their Discord server.</p> \n\n<p>When I created a ticket, some staff helped me, but he was a bit unprofessional. (Talking in Spanish in an English host, and more.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-20/1629472228-127013-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I asked for their node IPs to check if they were abusing some type of hosting/using the free credit, but somehow, they seem to be using Hetzner dedicated servers, even though they don't seem to be able to afford a paid domain, and there are very cheap domains on sav.com or Namecheap.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I proceeded to ask them where are their Privacy Policy and ToS after confirming their provider is Hetzner, and why they are operating without legal documents. Their staff said this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-20/1629472543-378350-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Then, he sent me some Privacy Policy &amp; TOS preview, but it seems to be generated, and it's invalid.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-20/1629472602-40276-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I also asked them, if they are paying for 3 Hetzner dedicated servers, then, why don't they get a paid domain? Also, gotta be loving when they use a client ticket as a staff chat! ( lol )</p> \n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-08-20/1629474434-9571-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>For anyone asking, these are their links:<br>\nDiscord Invite: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Rwe4VuZJbz\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.gg/Rwe4VuZJbz</a><br>\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://foxynodes.ml\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://foxynodes.ml</a><br>\nThe Privacy Policy they sent: <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/823611658726539285/878290119013044234/Privacy_policy.pdf\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/823611658726539285/878290119013044234/Privacy_policy.pdf</a></p>","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"3427"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"903"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"3427","attributes":{"username":"babyharpseal","displayName":"babyharpseal","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/gIjyTXWXF9yBA4uq.png","slug":"babyharpseal","joinTime":"2021-04-21T14:45:49+00:00","discussionCount":6,"commentCount":77,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2023-03-11T11:22:59+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"903","attributes":{"title":"\"FoxyNodes\" / Freenom Domain / Non-profesional staff / Operating without PP/ToS","slug":"903-foxynodes-freenom-domain-non-profesional-staff-operating-without-pptos","isApproved":true}}]}

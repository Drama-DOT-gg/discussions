When BlizzardNode only had a US node, this dude (Zachary) approached me and asked if he'd like to partner. I said okay, and what are you offering and what do you expect from us? He said that it's free advertisement and he'd give plugins. <br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596549388-609118-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596549415-961758-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nI asked him to send the screenshots of him purchasing the plugins on spigot. He was unable to do so.<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596549503-165637-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Anyways, time passes and he dm's me again. Basically he has a hosting company called SwithHosting and he plans on bringing Bot Hosting. So what he wanted to do was I provide him a VPS for bot hosting, and I get the profits. <br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596549652-922808-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe literally sells VPS'es, why can't he use one of those VPS'es? Also \"head of bot hosting\", the fuck?<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596549770-852042-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe also said that he's making a new website, and sent few screenshots.<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596549840-923407-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nI told him it was a theme from Envato (Was actually one from ColorLib)<br>\nHe told me it wasn't a theme from Envato. <br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596549895-714498-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I told him I'll have to discuss this with my staff members. I already wasn't keen on this, but wanted the best for BlizzardNode, so I considered it. <br>\nI decided to not go ahead with his offers for the following reasons;</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>Lied about owning plugins, </li>\n<li>Lied about saying he made his own website</li>\n<li>Staff also told me to not go ahead with this deal.</li></ol>\n\n<p>After I told him about this, he told me it was a theme from ColorLib<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596549962-654630-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHis excuse that it was customized. <br>\nAnyways, I told him I wasn't going to argue about this, I unfriended him but my DM's were open so he managed to say the following.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-04/1596550036-359324-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nTold me his plugins aren't leaked, but he was unable to provide proof that he owned the plugins.<br>\nHe then said \"i told you to answer with yes or no, i didint told you to tell me all these that doesnt make sense\". (That sentence doesn't make sense :p)<br>\nThen randomly said the following, \"just straight tell me you didint got clients so you had to respond with out of stock lmao\" <br>\nWe (BlizzardNode) have over 4 clients, from just one service.. <br>\n<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/574481581197230092/740195938345287852/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/574481581197230092/740195938345287852/unknown.png</a></p>\n\n<p>Anyways this dude shouldn't be selling hosting services, and in general you shouldn't deal with him.</p>\n\n<p><em>This thread is mainly about ZacharyTM, not SwithHosting</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","editedAt":"2020-08-04T14:16:25+00:00","canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"canHide":false,"canLike":true,"canFlag":true,"isApproved":true,"canApprove":false,"canReact":true},"relationships":{"user":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"62"}},"editedUser":{"data":{"type":"users","id":"62"}},"discussion":{"data":{"type":"discussions","id":"26"}},"likes":{"data":[]},"mentionedBy":{"data":[]},"reactions":{"data":[]}}},"included":[{"type":"users","id":"62","attributes":{"username":"ShinyPlasm","displayName":"ShinyPlasm","avatarUrl":"https://drama.gg/assets/avatars/sCQ7rLyzz8Fj4nhg.png","slug":"ShinyPlasm","joinTime":"2020-08-04T13:53:23+00:00","discussionCount":3,"commentCount":67,"canEdit":false,"canDelete":false,"lastSeenAt":"2022-01-23T07:17:22+00:00","canSuspend":false,"canEditPolls":false,"canStartPolls":true,"canSelfEditPolls":true,"canVotePolls":true,"cover":null,"cover_thumbnail":null,"canSetProfileCover":false,"canEditOwnNickname":false,"bio":null,"canViewBio":true,"canEditBio":false},"relationships":{"groups":{"data":[]}}},{"type":"discussions","id":"26","attributes":{"title":"Zacharyâ„¢#0001 and SwithHosting","slug":"26-zachary0001-and-swithhosting","isApproved":true}}]}

I'm assuming the CEO was hoping I wouldn't see the ban message because ya know, I was banned. However mobile notifications are a beautiful thing.</p> \n\n<p>I'm going to go over my previous post again with some added information.</p>\n\n<p>**After joining their discord I immediately notice a few things:</p>\n\n<p>They are condoning the use of bots being used as users (against Discord's TOS)</p>\n\n<p>Staff were condoning dos attacks</p>\n\n<p>A low level staff member (one that should not have access to such things) leaked the password to their website node and their 2nd node (Never said what it was to, but still did it)</p>\n\n<p>They are letting users post their passwords in chat (this one is kind of on the user but should still be removed from their chats anyway)</p>\n\n<p>The password for the website node and node2 were the same, and after a quick google points toward a Lego replacement kit. (Might be a coincidence)</p>\n\n<p>After telling the owner about the passwords and access to the nodes (staff leak too) the owner claimed it wasn't a big deal and that node2 was only for honeypot (which is still a security concern)</p>\n\n<p>The owner also only agreed to add an egg to the panel that allowed the generation of income for clients if he was given 1% of the profits from anyone who used it via bitcoin</p>\n\n<p>Their TOS is also virtually non existent:</p>\n\n<p>_1. it is strictly prohibited for admins to look at your server unless you allow them to or unless they are asked to fix something.</p>\n\n<p>you cannot zipbomb/forkbomb/sudo rm -rf /* the container in which you are running the server, if you do that, that wont do anything to us but you will get instant ban.<br>\nalts are not allowed, if you are caught using them you will get the ban.<br>\nif you ddos or cause damage to any of your servers, your ip will be most likely publicly exposed.<br>\nby signing up to yeet hosting you confirm you are +13 or you have parental authorization for using our services.<br>\ncryptomining in any way is strictly disallowed even if its chia mining.<br>\nrefer to respective hetzner and digital ocean TOS to know more on what you cant do.<br>\nlinks:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/terms-of-service-agreement/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/terms-of-service-agreement/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.hetzner.com/rechtliches/root-server/_\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.hetzner.com/rechtliches/root-server/_</a></p>\n\n<p>Notice how 4 threatens to publicly expose your IP address instead of reporting it</p>\n\n<p>They also do not have a privacy policy at all</p>\n\n<p>You can check their site here to see if I missed anything - <a href=\"https://www.mindustry.me/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.mindustry.me/</a>**</p>\n\n<p>So yeah very interesting right?

It is also better if they are registered as a company, but that is an <em>optional</em> step, some don't have the money/the age to open a company</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Check how well do they speak english</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they don't speak english/they speak with a very shitty spelling they are most likely 12</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Check if they have reviews</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Better if they have trustpilot, but if they don't, they should have a review/vouch channel in their discord server. Try to see if that is something a normal human will do</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Check how old their service is</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>On average</strong> the older, the better, if a host managed to survive for more than 4/5 months without any issue they are probably legit</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Ask for a free trial</p> </div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, if they offer one. Run diagnostics and try to see if they over-allocate or if they lie about their hardware. Over-allocation is usually shit and if they do that, leave them immediately</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>If the owner's name is Plexed or Badsk, leave immediately.</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Come on, let's be real here. He will dataleak and close, no doubt about that</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they use freenom?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they do use freenom go away. If you can pay for your node uptme and can't pay like 20 $ a year get the fuck out</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they use WHMCS? Is it nulled?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they use WHMCS, check if the theme is nulled or no. Again, if you have the money to run a node, and dont have the money to pay 20$ a month you shouldn't be running a host</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they  give invite rewards?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they do, leave them and report to discord. Please</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they hate drama.gg?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If in one of their rules they express their not happiness with d.gg they are not clear.</p> \n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Do they ask to pay with crypto?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they do, leave them. What kinda retard pays 20$ in crypto a month? come on now</p>\n\n<h3><strong>_ BONUS ROUND_</strong></h3>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Can they provide proof of invoices?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>If they can, you know they aren't scamming anyone. At least, i think. If they say that \"they gotta wait some time to get the invoice\" or \"i have many accounts, let me find it\" They are carding, leave them</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div><p>Are they indian?</p></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>While i have no issue with indians whatsoever watch out for indian kids that dont know how to write. <em>On average</em> You will get scammed</p>\n\n\n<p>I hope that this guide has helped you not get scammed.

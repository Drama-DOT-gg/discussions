That was to defend his old host, Hosticy, that used to run on MOFH (My own free host). ItsGamingTube has been able since his first days in this community to demonstrate his immaturity and sense of skidding projects from other people. <br>\nThis is ItsGamingTube: The rise and fall of a skid: a tale full of ban evasions, skidded projects and advertisements. <br>\nOn 2021's April fools day ItsGamingTube got banned from WinterHoax, for then creating an account on 15/04/2021 on the new Drama.gg! A month later the advertisements began, and he started advertising his new host, Hosticy.ml, basically everywhere. Go ahead, search it on Reddit. Search it on Google. You'll find this thing everywhere, he even advertised that on InfinityFree's forums (<a href=\"https://forum.infinityfree.net/t/itsgamingtube-rant-topic/45423/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://forum.infinityfree.net/t/itsgamingtube-rant-topic/45423/</a>). 5 months passed, and ItsGamingTube was back: he made a thread exposing a scam website. The poorly made thread even contained a few links with proof, the only issue is that they were links for his own website, that could’ve possibly been an IP grabber.<br>\nAfter making a low quality few threads he got banned from the platform, along with his threads.<br>\nThe next day he was back with his alts again (the user Tomas was the first one to notice, congrats!).<br>\nAfter this he got banned again, again and again. <br>\nDuring his ban period ItsGamingTube experimented the good feeling of joining free hosts on Discord, these include Artiom's Hosting, FalixNodes and DanBot Hosting. I'll only say that he got banned from Artiom's Host for using multiple accounts to get extra servers, he got banned from Falix for his childish behaviour and demonstrated his inability of chatting with someone without offending certain groups of people in DanBot Hosting.<br>\nAfter that, his bot, StarWatcher, was hacked and nuked the bot's own support server. The bot's MongoDB database was also erased and sold on a dark web forum because of his poor practices at protecting user data. (Source: a leaks Pastebin).<br>\nThat confirmed the fall of ItsGamingTube.<br>\nAnd here we are, today, ItsGamingTube is still ban evading here with the name of \"SVR\" on the forum and “Sir exploiter Roblox\" on the drama Discord. <br>\nI hope you enjoyed this thread, hopefully you’ll also enjoy discussing about him in the thread's replies. I’ll be posting all the screenshots for proof / references in my next messages.

At this time it was very abrupt. I had sent in an application two days prior, and received this after only talking a bit about me being a Swedish college student. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-08-27/1661594911-692562-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>While working at Humble I saw some very serious flaws in the support team. The people I worked with were amazing, but the way the entire staff system is set-up is straight up flawed. I was told early that usually newcomers to the staff team have a 2-4 week trial period. Where they get less pay than the rest of the team. I had no issues with this as I understand why you would have a system like this in place.</p>\n\n<p>About 2 weeks into August, the Manager \"_w41k3r\" informed the support team that he was dissatisfied with the current activity of newcomer support members.

As \"ARandomGuy\" tells me, I have to look into what I \"messed up\", which I am already aware of.

But as I have observed, this is how the Management often manages things.</p>\n\n<p>The Management seems to be \"_w41k3r\" and the owner \"Jake\" who has been on like 3 times since I started working there in the beginning of August.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from that I wish anyone involved in this host good luck, and I would like to see other peoples opinions on this.</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"48637","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2022-08-27T15:04:54+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Meet Ben (aka Goober), a kid exposing user data (emails and IP addresses) on a public Discord server and Pastebin, being extremely toxic with everyone (except his friends), threatening everyone on the list that they will get a DDoS attack and much more just because RbxDomains owner said \"The real reason Goober quit. Man decided to switch to Bloxy.pro for whatever reason and is now developing a panel for them lol\" (Full quote). <br>\nSo let's start with the beginning. Ben has been a good RbxDomains admin, he made them a free panel (completely free), managed tickets and he was so good that everyone appreciate him. But one day he randomly decided to switch to BloxyPro (RbxDomains competitor) for absolutely no reason. Everyone felt so bad when he left RbxDomains, even the owner, Doeke. 5 days later Doeke sent the message (scroll up to find it) and Ben was mad just because of that. And, after a long discussion in the general chat, Ben leaked all of our IPs and email addresses in the RbxDomains discord server. I didn't see it, because it was deleted really fast. And because Goober still wanted to post our data to the public, he put the data on a public paste on Pastebin. But fortunately, Pastebin took actions on that paste so it was permanently deleted. Finally, Ben has been threatening us for days with DDoS attacks, and a lot of people were extremely scared. I had a dynamic IP so I was lucky.

Нет? Но мы расскажем вам о нём!</p>\n\n<p>RussiaNodes - самый больной и ненормальный хостинг серверов Minecraft за всю историю RU майнкрафта. <br>\nЧем же он так плох? <br>\nПройдёмся по некоторым аргументам:</p>\n\n<p>Владельцы размещают 15000 серверов на 2 узлах Hetzner под free тарифы, а также 1000+ северов на 7 узлах под платные тарифы. Как сообщает сам владелец RussiaNodes (Fanger) - они докупают донатерские узлы, только если SWAP забит на 80% (половина ОЗУ всех узлов - это swap), что же такое SWAP? Swap - файл подкачки, который преобразует дисковое пространство в ОЗУ, однако диск по определению не может быть качественной оперативной памятью, по итогу скорость Swap'а ниже DDR1.</p>\n\n<p>Оплачивают сервера Hetzner через украинца. То есть, если этот украинец уйдёт из состава, то всё, прощай RussiaNodes и все ваши данные.<br>\nСкриншот переписки с сервера хостинга ApexNodes:<br>\n<img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/891338946544533556/999061152875171920/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nНет никакого собственного AntiDDoS, то есть совсем нету. Протестировав с друзьями мы обнаружили, что VDS на 4 ядра способна положить узел с серверами на их хостинге меньше чем за минуту. Также мы узнали у владельца что у них и правда нет AntiDDoS. Оказывается, по словам владельца, они используют базовую защиту AntiDDOS от OVH. (Хотя на самом деле такой защиты у них нет, на данный момент они её только тестируют, начиная с 15 июля 2022)<br>\nВот скриншот переписки на сервере ApexNodes:<br>\n<img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/891338946544533556/999061135217152092/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nВсе владельцы хостинга еще ходят в школу (от 13-15 лет). Да, именно так. Вы доверяете благополучие своего сервера малолетним имбицилам с манией величия, которые не умеют здраво оценивать ситуацию и разумно мыслить. Пример: Один их клиент скинул консоль сервера не их хостинга (названий, лого хостинга не было видно). Ему выдали мут. Причина: \"сторонний хост\". Гениально. И таких примеров ОЧЕНЬ и ОЧЕНЬ много.</p>\n\n<p>Панель управления лагает так, что хочется повесится. Вылеты вам обеспеченны.</p> \n\n<p>Нет никакой официальной регистрации будь то ип или еще что. А значит, что если они вдруг решат закрыться, то подать иск в суд, в полицию или куда либо ещё вы не сможете) Прощайте все ваши данные.<br>\nИменно поэтому когда RussiaNodes v1 закрылся из за дешевого дерьмо-провайдера Contabo, вы просрали все свои сборки. Я был в этом числе, в моей сборке было лобби которое я строил 3 часа. Но потом когда я хотел его скачать, бубум и нет RussiaNodes.</p>\n\n<p>Изменили домен с russianodes.ru на russianodes.com т.к не хотят платить налоги.</p>\n\n<p>Панель даже не переведена (например у ApexNodes аддон на языки) и нет никаких аддонов почти (мелочь но факт)</p> \n\n<p>Хостинг 2 месяца назад был на грани закрытия. 20 гигабайт озу за 777 рублей думаю всем понятно что бред.</p> \n\n<p>Кстати, знаете почему так много ОЗУ на тарифах? Это называется SWAP! Они могут купить выделенный сервер на 4 ГБ ОЗУ, много ядер и 4ТБ Диска и от 4 тб диска забрать 252 ГБ для оперативной памяти. Но к счастью они покупают сервера с большим количеством ОЗУ.</p>\n\n<p>Сайт полон уязвимостей, багов и тд. К тому же от дизайна и симетрии сайта глаза болят.<br>\nДополнительно: нет защиты от ботов, придётся ставить ужасный BotFilter или защиту от TCPShield:<br>\n<img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/891338946544533556/999060910666678342/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<h3>Прочее</h3>\n\n<p>На сайте расположены доисторические отзывы о RussiaNodes v1 (сейчас RussiaNodes v3)</p>\n\n<p>Также отзывы на сайте будут только самые лучшие. Ведь там написано что плохие отзывы они оставят и снизу кнопка оставить отзыв, которая ведёт в группу ВК. Только вот где там оставлять отзыв? Пёс его знает!</p>\n\n<p>Авторизация только через Discord. То есть если вы просто хотели поиграть с друзьями вам придётся регистрировать аккаунт в Discord чтобы потом создать аккаунт на RussiaNodes.</p>\n\n<p>Оплата через FreeKassa и Qiwi. Оплата через FK работает отлично а вот через QIWI можно просрать деньги<br>\nВо первых после перевода на Qiwi нужно открыть страницу для получения денег и написать идентификатор платежа. Во вторых оплата через Qiwi почти всегда отключена. Узнать об этом можно только в Discord-сервере.</p>\n\n<p>После авторизации через Discord вас автоматически подключит к их Discord-серверу. Без разницы, бесплатный вы клиент или нет. Вы все равно будете иметь желание выйти с этого Discord-сервера. Потому-что постоянно, каждый день вы будете видеть @everyone в количестве миллион, при чём по всякой мелочи. Иногда даже там есть реклама никому не нужных видео Fanger'a с @everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Владельцы хостинга почти ничего не делают. Все уязвимости закрывает MrWarka. Который недавно ушёл с RussiaNodes и Fanger сразу в объявлениях написал чтобы Варке в лс спамили \"Вернить на ПарашаНодес\".</p>\n\n<h3>Дискорд сервер</h3>\n\n<p>Как я уже говорил, чрезмерный пинг по @everyone где вам скажут \"DONATOR 1 УПАЛА НА 1 СЕК\".</p>\n\n<p>Канал с новой панелью? Да зачем он! Это же просто html шаблон. Ведь MrWarka ушёл и панель делать некому.</p>\n\n<p>Тех.Поддержка и состав... Самое худшее... Во первых 70% состава и поддержки украинцы. Если вы напишите 1 раз что-то плохо о них, то всё... Бесконечный мут вам обеспечен. Но если они напишут плохо о вас, всем будет всё-равно.</p>\n\n<p>Мелочи Discord-сервера: перегрузка бесполезными каналами, устаревший дизайн, не нужные боты.</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"48304","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2022-07-20T05:22:25+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>So their is this guy named \"Booji\" and he has this discord server called \"Booji's buyers\" and what they basically do is sell reduced doordash prices and sell nuke bots and apparently do Cash Flips, now this guy has this whole channel dedicated to proofs and it looks like every person in the server is happy with him, so I just wanted to test if he was a scammer or not so I did cash flip because I dont feel safe giving this random dude my Address, and so I said if I cash app you $5 how much will you give?

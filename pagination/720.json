(You're a Data controller providing services to many Data Subjects (Client) which means you need a custom ToS and most certainly Priv. Something generated won't do its duties.</p>\n \n <p>c) not following your own ToS, Priv. The Provider is just as accountable as the Client if not more when it comes to legal agreements and if you don't follow your own rules you may be fined a hefty amount. Sources from the UK (ItGovernance.co.uk) state that a violating Controller of GDPR (General Data Privacy Rule) is fined anywhere up to €20M or 4% of annual profit.</p>\n \n \n <p>Where do I get a TOS?

In all seriousness though, how does he expect us to believe this? He's also not at all transparent about his heart condition, and how he's \"dying\".

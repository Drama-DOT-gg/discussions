I was staff on a Minecraft server called MeleeCraft a while back (about a year ago), and today I got a random message from one of the servers members. He was mentioning my role as Developer back on MeeleCraft and asked if I wanted to get an invite to his server he was making.</p>\n\n<p>And you all hear how that sounds. It sounds like he is either wanting me to help him out, or to \"apply\" (they had some google form thing, idk I never got to see it as it was closed), or inviting me as a Dev on their server. But to my surprise, this was a 15 year old, very immature owner that wasted my time for almost 2 hours of productive development time. I literally sat and waited for him to open the application to the point where I couldn't work normally, and here is our conversation.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-17/1626548712-619290-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nAt first he seemed like he was a real full fletched Owner that knew what he was doing. (there were 2 other owners and at least 2 managers on the server. I am guessing now afterwards he is not the one doing stuff.

However as you can see I waited for over an hour for him to even respond. And when he did, it sounded like I was to blame for pushing him. He made me wait for a full hour before blaming his internet, and saying he was hanging out with his family. He also asked why I \"kept joining and leaving\". I left twice. Once when he didn't respond in the start, and once when I had to wait for over an hour on him to respond. He also didn't really seem to understand that he was making a bad impression against me. He just shook it off and said \"I didn't do nothing\".</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-17/1626549153-827047-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe then proceeded to even further try to \"blame\" me for not \"wanting to support a 15 year old\", to which I replied his age had nothing to do with it, and that I had tried to support and help him for over an hour to no avail.

So, he left a 3 star review because our servers are laggy as we don't give a ton of CPU on the free plan (which was the case quite a while ago, but we give a ton more than that now), nothing wrong with that, and I respect his review.</p>\n\n<p>What I don't respect is him going into general, asking for the resources he got for inviting 20 people even after 7 of them left and never joined back. Everytime we asking him for the resources, he said \"X stars\", X always being lower than his previous review. If this doesn't make it isn't awfully obvious that he was trying to sell us reviews, I don't know what will.<br>\nChecking his invites:<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842607156661846047/849511558110249000/Screenshot_601.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nAypro offered the resources back if he gave proof of everyone joining back, but he tackled it with \"sMh 2 STarS nOW\".<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842607156661846047/849511563828527124/Screenshot_603.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842607156661846047/849511558827606026/Screenshot_602.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nDecreasing the review score even further after I denied to give resources<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842607156661846047/849511566297792512/Screenshot_605.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nBad support because we aren't giving you resources for literally nothing?

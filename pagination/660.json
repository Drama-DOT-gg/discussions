blackcat and Rihard<br>\nThey used to just be a MC server. Then they got a VPS for their MC servers and it always got overallocated by blackcat. This was also around the time my host was starting up and you will see why this is important. So I bought a node and a little later Rihard(that owns the VPS btw) offered to use it for my host and I said sure. Now arc profits where low and HUGE SERVERS where popping up where I had to balance the earning system and reset everyone's coins. So Rihard sees this and got mad so he says fuck you I am making my own host but he did let us get the data off first. So back story out of the way. now the juicy stuff! So he claimed what I did was unfair and thought he could do better. Also because I wanted to poke them I told them to remove some code I made when they where a MC server. They did remove the code. After their dumbasses start asking for devs and not just asking OUTRIGHT BEGGING. Ofc i was one person they begged. they also begged my co-ower Matt. Now that doesn't sound too bad but they are basically copying everything about my host and don't rlly know shit about running a host yet somehow go and buy VPSs. So they asked me to do there crap so I took the chance and pulled the biggest troll of all time. Now the owner being dumb couldn't setup DNS so I went to freenom and picked up and domain and proceeded to install ptero using that. Still the owner thinks I set it up and his domain. Legit dumest owners out there. i will post pics as replies. Also if your too lazy to install ptero and have IQ i can do that lol.</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"6473","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-02-12T14:06:30+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Just a General Request before creating a post on the site saying a company is using nulled WHMCS, speak to the owners because, recently a topic was opened on my company when we were just having a payment issue with WHMCS, this makes us look bad and make people think we have used a NUlled WHMCS when we really don't</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"6300","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-02-09T18:20:22+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Let's see, where do I begin.</p>\n\n<p>To start, this hosting company is terrible, among the worst I have ever seen.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>Selling FiveM Servers (which is not permitted according to the FiveM ToS)</li>\n<li>Unprofessional Staff</li>\n<li>Unreliable Services</li>\n<li>Not friendly to other hosts.</li>\n<li>Kinda bad site.</li>\n<li>No Public Node Info</li>\n<li>Possibly Stolen ToS</li></ol>\n\n<p>Explanation:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>In terms of selling FiveM servers, you can check that here <a href=\"https://cq-servers.com/fivem\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cq-servers.com/fivem</a></li>\n<li>A staff member said this in a livechat, this is mainly how they all act.

I had 14 USD added to the account (had 25 when we started the entire thing), and now, my account don't work. I tried the password reset but I don't get an email.

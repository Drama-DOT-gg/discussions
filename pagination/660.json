Firstly it took them over 2 months to buy whmcs from release and in that 2 months he made the excuse constantly he \"Had a social life too\". Yeh, and you wanna run a good business. He also uses a 16gb contabo node with a 4 vcore processor. He seems to think that AMD EPYC is just 1 cpu as he says they have an AMD EPYC cpu when people ask lol.<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-07/1615153467-77177-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe also is using a 1gb EC2 node from amazon as their US node<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-07/1615153521-940019-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nNice. Using a free VPS for your host. Also one of their ex-staff members downloaded my files from a server I had with them and took my bot token and everything (And it is a verified bot too.) <img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-07/1615153719-561745-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nJex also never stuck with any idea I gave and whenever I did try and push one like switching from 1.0 pterodactyl to 0.7 for addons and theming then he constantly accused me of being pushy. Whenever I threatened to leave as well he always blamed it on the fact that we weren't switching to 0.7 but instead it was because nothing had happened at all and I was getting bored. Also one of their current staff members has a DNDW role in the winterhoax discord. Jex also likes to bring up my past and other winterhoaxes that I have proven wrong like me using a website builder for someone, but he is yet to use that brain of his to see the evidence I showed him. I bet he will reply to this talking about my past lol. In conclusion, DO NOT buy from these guys, you get a shitty cpu from a shitty VPS that can barely handle 2 minecraft servers. (Discovered that one in my testing).</p>\n\n<p>Will post updated here.</p>\n"}},{"type":"posts","id":"5901","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-02-06T12:01:41+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>So i was usually roaming around on discord and i joined a free hosting server called zeohost, all the things they do looks nice but the staff are kids tbh. like WTF...<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-06/1612612703-741108-screenshot-from-2021-02-06-172326.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-06/1612612716-133902-screenshot-from-2021-02-06-172342.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-06/1612612722-803172-screenshot-from-2021-02-06-172434.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/peyKrZg3fB\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.gg/peyKrZg3fB</a> is the server invite,</p>\n\n<p>LIKE WTF i DIDNT go toxic or anything their staff go and i got a warn for being toxic... yeah the word \"hell\" seems toxic to them wtf</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"6666","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-02-14T20:01:13+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Hey, I found this host when I was looking around to see if I could buy any..</p> \n\n<p>They, don't provide a VAT Number or anything on that line.</p>\n\n<p>False Advertising: <br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-14/1613332783-325332-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-02-14/1613332815-850628-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Discord Invite Link:  <a href=\"https://discord.gg/VFaeWD3yft\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.gg/VFaeWD3yft</a><br>\nOwner ID: 704971602613239829 &amp; Didaka#1337</p>\n\n<p>Best Regards,<br>\nAces, Owner of RoseMC.</p>\n\n\n"}},{"type":"posts","id":"7875","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-03-04T19:09:27+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Sooo I joined <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/9yda6jnM62\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.com/invite/9yda6jnM62</a> and i went to info did some things clicked on the link andddd</p>\n\n\n<p>the video explains the last bit...      <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/519636627\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://vimeo.com/519636627</a></p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"7001","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-02-21T06:53:31+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Alright this thread is done but just see 7 march.</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"6319","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-02-10T07:56:33+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>darknode is a fucking scam....i was an ex-owner of it they used me and find some good dev and files after that they brought vps of 8gb and said adding 50gb swap i said no its illegal to have a huge amount of swap they said they dont care and the client and main page of darknode is from creative tim and they did gived credits to him , they used .tk (free domain) and now they are abusing iolons and hetzner (its a fucking scam dont trust them )and they made privacy policy yesterday when i said to make one they are not even a registerd company its DAMN BULLSHIT!!!now when they got a funder they demoted me and made him the owner nice hosting!!!!!</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"7652","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-03-02T17:37:53+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2021-03-02/1614706662-190536-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drama.gg/u/Withdrawal\" class=\"UserMention\">@Withdrawal</a></p> \n\n<p>uhhhh</p> "}},{"type":"posts","id":"859","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2020-08-11T19:01:55+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Owner DM Advertised his/her hosting<br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-11/1597172464-191083-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-08-11/1597172477-634468-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nWas also in mchost discord but got banned after reporting him.</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"6868","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-02-20T00:22:09+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>So some backstory on this host. the owners are blackcat and Rihard<br>\nThey used to just be a MC server. Then they got a VPS for their MC servers and it always got overallocated by blackcat. This was also around the time my host was starting up and you will see why this is important. So I bought a node and a little later Rihard(that owns the VPS btw) offered to use it for my host and I said sure. Now arc profits where low and HUGE SERVERS where popping up where I had to balance the earning system and reset everyone's coins. So Rihard sees this and got mad so he says fuck you I am making my own host but he did let us get the data off first. So back story out of the way. now the juicy stuff! So he claimed what I did was unfair and thought he could do better. Also because I wanted to poke them I told them to remove some code I made when they where a MC server. They did remove the code. After their dumbasses start asking for devs and not just asking OUTRIGHT BEGGING. Ofc i was one person they begged. they also begged my co-ower Matt. Now that doesn't sound too bad but they are basically copying everything about my host and don't rlly know shit about running a host yet somehow go and buy VPSs. So they asked me to do there crap so I took the chance and pulled the biggest troll of all time. Now the owner being dumb couldn't setup DNS so I went to freenom and picked up and domain and proceeded to install ptero using that. Still the owner thinks I set it up and his domain. Legit dumest owners out there. i will post pics as replies. Also if your too lazy to install ptero and have IQ i can do that lol.</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"6473","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-02-12T14:06:30+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Just a General Request before creating a post on the site saying a company is using nulled WHMCS, speak to the owners because, recently a topic was opened on my company when we were just having a payment issue with WHMCS, this makes us look bad and make people think we have used a NUlled WHMCS when we really don't</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"6300","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-02-09T18:20:22+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Let's see, where do I begin.</p>\n\n<p>To start, this hosting company is terrible, among the worst I have ever seen.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>Selling FiveM Servers (which is not permitted according to the FiveM ToS)</li>\n<li>Unprofessional Staff</li>\n<li>Unreliable Services</li>\n<li>Not friendly to other hosts.</li>\n<li>Kinda bad site.</li>\n<li>No Public Node Info</li>\n<li>Possibly Stolen ToS</li></ol>\n\n<p>Explanation:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>In terms of selling FiveM servers, you can check that here <a href=\"https://cq-servers.com/fivem\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cq-servers.com/fivem</a></li>\n<li>A staff member said this in a livechat, this is mainly how they all act.

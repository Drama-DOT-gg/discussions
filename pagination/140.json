(A great thread about that is <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/1224-guide-to-not-getting-scammed\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Guide to not getting scammed</a>, definitely worth a read.) I get it, y'all are kids hungry for attention, but this is not the way. We want high-quality content, not all of this absolute garbage. Hence why I'll start with the rules (partly taken from our Discord server as well), anyone not complying with this <strong>will</strong> get punished. For now, this is only for new threads and posts, but once I - and perhaps the other members of the team - have more time we will most likely go and review the currently existing threads. Anyway, I have waited months for someone higher up to make this, but I guess that I should take this into my own hands instead.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Rules:</strong></h3>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li><p>Use your common sense.<br>\nJust don't be a dick. That's about everything this rule is.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Advertising/offering services is strictly prohibited.<br>\nWe are not an advertisement forum, for that stuff you should go to something like <a href=\"https://www.mc-market.org/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">MC-Market</a>.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Treat others with respect.<br>\nRegardless of role, rank, gender, age, affiliation, etc. Any kind of discrimination is prohibited.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Do not harass members.<br>\nIf a member wishes to not be contacted by a person, respect the person's decision.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Do not discuss illegal operations.<br>\nSuch as hacking, DDoSing, doxing, leaking, or threatening to attack the server/other users.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Do not use alternate accounts.<br>\nUnless within reasoning, and a Drama.gg team member has approved the request.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Ignorance of the rules is not a valid excuse for breaking them.<br>\nIf a team member pursues a punishment, which is within reason, there is no need to fight it.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>This is not a leaking/raiding forum, so do not use it as one.<br>\nIf you do, you <strong>will</strong> get a permanent ban.</p></li></ol>\n\n<p>And lastly, I think it's fair to add a rule for \"no users under the age of 13\". There is no real way to check this, but if we find out that you are breaking this rule it will result in a <strong>permanent ban</strong>. The above rules can change at any time without notice, so please make sure to return to this thread every now and then.</p>\n\n<p>PS: also don't bump old threads, thanks.</p>\n\n<p>With that out of the way, let's get on to the information side of things.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Information:</strong></h3>\n<ul><li><p>What is Drama.gg?<br>\nDrama.gg is a community for exposing fraudulent companies and businesses.

I was then asked 'how much is tax' (screenshot provided). For a host charging sales tax to not know the percentage, yeah that's a massive red flag. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925023-932657-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Proxala (inc)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Upon receiving my stripe link to pay Proxala, the email and my bank statement both said Proxala Inc, as shown here<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925137-369233-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"> and here <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925189-353787-image0.png\" title=\"\">. When i questioned Aspect (The owner of Proxala) about this, he blamed my bank and said that it was lying.

Obviously, we should have, but i was more concerned with checking ipmi to make sure the server is legitimate, etc, and gave the infomation to my technician to install virtulizor on it. <br>\nI awoke at around 3am my time today, to find out that my service had been suspended at 1am today, due to the cpu being maxed for 4h, which firstly id like to point out that its a dedicated server and why was he looking at my server files (he stated he kvmed in), and secondly the fact that he tried to keep it frozen and not issue a refund is questionable. I went back to sleep.</p> \n\n<p>Additionally, his method of suspending my server is questionable, his suspension method was to unplug the server, rather than disconnecting network, or a safe power down. This suspension method is incredibly alarming, due to the fact that if i was transferring files, or something, it could potentially corrupt something.</p> \n\n<p>I further probed him on this around 12pm today ish and was told to email in to request a login (i had forgotten he sent the new login via discord due to my tiredness this morning). I emailed in with the following '''Hi bitch give me my login info k ty', not exactly professional, but expresses my frustration at his refusal to reset the password because i asked him on discord, even though I had ordered, and paid via a stripe link on discord. He then stated he had disabled the server again, no reason was provided. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925651-743385-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Refusing Refunds</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aspect stated that i had been refunded for this service<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925800-863011-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\n, however after further probing, he revealed that a refund has not been issued, and that he wanted me to make a ticket on his billing panel<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925807-777879-capture1.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nWhich i dont think i even have a login for, i dont know my password, and frankly i dont want to go onto his site.</p> \n\n<p><strong>Overall Shady Services</strong></p>\n\n<p>The IPs provided for this server are shown as Verizon Residential IPs</p>\n\n<p>(68.132.35.101<br>\n68.132.35.102<br>\n68.132.35.103<br>\n68.132.35.104<br>\n68.132.35.105)<br>\nHowever, he states that they are DC IPs, and it is 'wrong', which i heavily doubt, he has not provided proof of having any Rackspace in the location the server was delivered to me in (NY), and the ips all match up to be Verizion ips, the only proof of him having Rackspace was a picture of a genetic ass looking rack, with 10 year old storage servers in.</p> "}},{"type":"tags","id":"4","attributes":{"name":"Discussion","description":"Threads which are open for discussion.","slug":"discussion","color":"#15d4a7","backgroundUrl":null,"backgroundMode":null,"icon":"far fa-comment-alt","discussionCount":479,"position":3,"defaultSort":null,"isChild":false,"isHidden":false,"lastPostedAt":"2023-10-24T17:32:49+00:00","canStartDiscussion":true,"canAddToDiscussion":true}},{"type":"tags","id":"5","attributes":{"name":"More","description":"Other tags.","slug":"more","color":"#15d4a7","backgroundUrl":null,"backgroundMode":null,"icon":"fas fa-ellipsis-h","discussionCount":593,"position":4,"defaultSort":null,"isChild":false,"isHidden":false,"lastPostedAt":"2023-10-27T21:11:23+00:00","canStartDiscussion":true,"canAddToDiscussion":true}},{"type":"tags","id":"7","attributes":{"name":"Illegal Activities","description":"People or companies which perform illegal activities such as fraud, all kinds of cybercrime, and more.","slug":"illegal-activities","color":"#15d4a7","backgroundUrl":null,"backgroundMode":null,"icon":"","discussionCount":302,"position":2,"defaultSort":null,"isChild":true,"isHidden":false,"lastPostedAt":"2023-10-26T16:27:59+00:00","canStartDiscussion":true,"canAddToDiscussion":true}},{"type":"tags","id":"8","attributes":{"name":"Unprofessional","description":"People or organizations which act fairly unprofessional in professional conversations.","slug":"unprofessional","color":"#15d4a7","backgroundUrl":null,"backgroundMode":null,"icon":"","discussionCount":355,"position":1,"defaultSort":null,"isChild":true,"isHidden":false,"lastPostedAt":"2023-10-26T16:27:59+00:00","canStartDiscussion":true,"canAddToDiscussion":true}},{"type":"tags","id":"6","attributes":{"name":"Scammers","description":"People or organizations which have scammed people.","slug":"scammers","color":"#15d4a7","backgroundUrl":null,"backgroundMode":null,"icon":"","discussionCount":210,"position":0,"defaultSort":null,"isChild":true,"isHidden":false,"lastPostedAt":"2023-10-26T16:27:59+00:00","canStartDiscussion":true,"canAddToDiscussion":true}},{"type":"tags","id":"3","attributes":{"name":"Confirmed","description":"Cases which have been confirmed by a Drama.gg team member.","slug":"confirmed","color":"#15d4a7","backgroundUrl":null,"backgroundMode":null,"icon":"far fa-check-circle","discussionCount":15,"position":2,"defaultSort":null,"isChild":false,"isHidden":false,"lastPostedAt":"2023-08-19T01:14:40+00:00","canStartDiscussion":false,"canAddToDiscussion":false}},{"type":"tags","id":"9","attributes":{"name":"Bad Services","description":"People or organizations which offer a poor service.","slug":"bad","color":"#15d4a7","backgroundUrl":null,"backgroundMode":null,"icon":"","discussionCount":312,"position":3,"defaultSort":null,"isChild":true,"isHidden":false,"lastPostedAt":"2023-09-26T15:17:33+00:00","canStartDiscussion":true,"canAddToDiscussion":true}},{"type":"polls","id":"36","attributes":{"question":"is he wrong","hasEnded":false,"publicPoll":true,"endDate":null,"createdAt":"2021-04-23T23:49:17+00:00","updatedAt":"2021-04-23T23:49:17+00:00"}}]}

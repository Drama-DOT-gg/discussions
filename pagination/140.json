I want to try to see potential in people like Plexed, except (pls don't hate me plexed) he manages to somehow make a host that dies within few days. I probably shouldn't defend them, but <del>I'm bored so I do it anyways</del>.</p>\n\n<p>also, stop. making. fricking. dashactyl. 0.x. forks. use an actual panel. WHMCS, Blesta, BoxBilling, etc... SO MANY BETTER ALTERNATIVES. or just use dashactyl as it is. ngl you guys suck at javascript (most of you) and there's always exploits I can find, and 0.x are already exploit HEAVY.</p>\n\n<p>you guys get more simps and shit that support you along the way. guess what? most of the people don't even care about you or some shit. they care about having a good server hosting. if you really wanted to make a free host, you would actually want to sustain the host, and make the services usable, like centronodes. like look at <a href=\"https://centronodes.com/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://centronodes.com/</a> ... the host can actually sustain. what about the simps you actually get on your host? they are all toxic assholes always defending for you. fucking little kids.</p>\n\n<p>add a tos and privacy policy please. at least try to be legally operated. stop abusing stuff like trials and exploits on vps sites just to get free nodes. freenom is ok if you actually pay for the domain. but most .tk etc domains aren't paid for. you know how easily it is a snipe a freenom domain by paying for it right? you can buy a domain even if you got it for free, so people can just steal a domain from you. why even bother using free freenom?</p>\n\n<p>please stop making slow af client areas. actually consider making a good frontend that's optimized or has seemless loading. user experience is one of the key things in order to get more people using your host.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>wanna know how to actually make a good free host?</p>\n\n<p>well. if you do, learn how to make a good HOST in general first. google it. and study it hard. learn how to make a good sustainable BUSINESS too. learn how to be a support team member, and few other roles. learn how to do sys admin, and etc so many things you should learn before making a host.</p>\n\n<p>one of my biggest regrets doing stuff in the small-hosting industry (ig sorta) is that i made a client area called dashactyl... it's not the panel itself that was a regret, but it was how \"unsustainable\" it was, and many free hosts use it today. hosts die quickly since it's not... sustainable. giving resources forever after paying once is a terrible idea.</p>\n\n<p>then, work as volunteers on some actual hosts. learn how it actually feels to be a support team member, or some other job on a host. try new roles every now and then... learn and PRACTICE how to be good at this.</p>\n\n<p>after you did all that, all you really need to know is how you would sustain a free host. well, one way you can do is be like me and think of an idea on how you can be <em>different</em> from other sh*t hosts. (yah I'm planning on making a sustainable panel for free hosts... won't be free for everyone tho.)</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>another way is referencing other hosting providers.</p>\n\n<ul><li>even aternos is better than most free hosts ran by skids because it's sustainable. aternos has a ton of ads on their panel on shuts off their server when there are no servers. they overallocate.</li>\n<li>centronodes. stuff. idk i forgot how it works, but i remember stuff like idk an afk page.</li>\n<li>server.pro. fast free servers. queue system. renewal system. expensive af paid plans.</li>\n<li>idk STUFF.</li></ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>any tips i have?</p>\n\n<ul><li>people hate the word \"renewal\". name it something else and change it up a bit. :)</li>\n<li>idk don't rely on arc.io completely. rely on ads, paid plans, offerwalls, etc.</li>\n<li>bruh you think i'm gonna give you more tips? study it yourself.</li></ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>ok i'm done with my shit rant thing or something ok bai. don't hate me if you got offended by any of this pls.</p> \n\n<p>the hosting shit could have a lot less drama in it if some people <em>cough</em> didn't make <em>cough</em> a site specifically about dramas. there are some people here who specifically use this site to cause drama <em>cough cough you know who you are</em>. some of you guys want to give themselves a better image when it really isn't giving you one.</p> \n\n<p>i wish people found another way to lower the amount of drama (it's impossible to remove completely 'drama' from existence in any community), like possibly thoroughly convincing people to stop making hosts. specifically the little ones.</p> \n\n<p>anyways feel free to criticize this post. don't mind the grammar mistakes. I rushed to write this, and it's night now. imma head out.</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"47262","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2022-04-27T16:01:30+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>So I was contacted by my advertising manager with a partnership opportunity from a \"new\" hosting company.

For now, this is only for new threads and posts, but once I - and perhaps the other members of the team - have more time we will most likely go and review the currently existing threads.

I waited a while then proceeded to message developly I asked him when the website was gonna be ready so we started working on it then we got all the benefits done he then proceeds to say I will try to get the website setup and running then said I will try not to die for 2 weeks again because I asked for the website and he ignored me for 2 weeks then after that i gave him a week to get the website going. he still didn't do it so I messaged him and asked if he had my files for the website and he came back with my computer was messed up then I went to the developer that actually made it and asked if he had the files he said yes but the developer also didn't get paid for his work all because he was given two days to make a really nice website 2 days is by far not enough time to make a really good website. this dude thinks scamming people is gonna get him somewhere in life with his little scam of a business.<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-03-18/1647647869-637429-scam.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n"}},{"type":"posts","id":"38075","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-12-14T16:59:43+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Plexed (aka badsk) has just made a brand new \"Free Host\".

This thread is for those who are new to hosting and want to set up their own server on an unknown 24/7 server hosting provider. First of all, let's check the IPs of your hosting provider to see which hosting they are using. Providers like Contabo and Azure often offer free trial nodes, so let's discuss what free trials are.</p>\n\n<p>Free trials are like test runs for a limited period, usually ranging from 1 to 12 months, during which you can try out a hosting service without committing to a long-term payment plan. It's like checking out a demo of a website before you decide to buy or use it.</p>\n\n<p>However, be cautious of hosting providers that frequently experience data loss either monthly or every 2 to 3 months. This could be a sign of scammers who abuse nodes and engage in illegal practices to obtain the hosting node. Unfortunately, I can't provide specific names, but be aware of common groups like rus.js, qlox, duck, and others who have been involved in such activities since 2021.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure your data is safe and your hosting experience is smooth, it's best to use reputable and paid hosting services. While free trials might seem attractive, paid hosting offers more reliability and support, reducing the risk of data loss or other issues.</p>\n\n<p>Stay safe and make informed choices when selecting a hosting provider.

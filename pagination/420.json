They use HostVenom and their specs for the Chicago location are i7-6700K and likely 64 GB ram (the max memory that processor can handle). The irony here is when they say: \"That would include DDOS Protection 2 Cores of a CPU and 8GB RAM and also being on a Panel This would also stop you being on a Overallocated Server as you would have your own server just for you.\" Really? The i7-6700K only has 4 cores/8 threads and you're giving them 2 cores, which is half of the processor already and 1/8 of the system's memory. If you do the same to one more customer and allocate them 2 cores, then your cores aren't dedicated anymore, they're shared/overallocated.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875884186496532491/882361605365571604/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/875884186496532491/882361605365571604/unknown.png\"><br>\nIn their discord, they claim to have secured Los Angeles, Miami, and New York (since the beginning of the month of August 2021).

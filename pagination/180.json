Heres the link to the code he showed <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/yKGtD4E0\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://pastebin.com/yKGtD4E0</a>, or if your too lazy to click on it, here is a screenshot. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-25/1643078145-873250-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>When I saw this code, I thought there was something suspicious as our little friend Izak hasn't even learned how to change his own diaper, so theres no way he actually knows how to code. After seeing this, I decided to dig a little deeper, scouring the internet looking for where out little baby Izak found this piece of code.</p> \n\n<p>In the end I stumbled across this github repo, that looks very similar to the code our friend Izak left us: <a href=\"https://github.com/invader1234/discord-dm-1.7.2/blob/main/bot.py\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/invader1234/discord-dm-1.7.2/blob/main/bot.py</a> .

Incase you all are wondering if perhaps this code was stolen off of our friend Izak and perhaps not the other way around, I have to say, ...... <em>You are a dumbass</em>.

backstory, Proxala had been selling 9900k Dedicated Servers for 72 Euro excluding tax, as this pricing is stupidly low, I decided to purchase a server, to see the flaws in their service, with the intention of verifying if they were legit, or not, and cancelling the server.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Questioning Tax Registration</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first red flag to me was the claim that the 90eur included Netherlands sales tax, I asked this to be removed as we were a UK company, and this request was honored. I was then asked 'how much is tax' (screenshot provided). For a host charging sales tax to not know the percentage, yeah that's a massive red flag. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925023-932657-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Proxala (inc)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Upon receiving my stripe link to pay Proxala, the email and my bank statement both said Proxala Inc, as shown here<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925137-369233-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"> and here <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925189-353787-image0.png\" title=\"\">. When i questioned Aspect (The owner of Proxala) about this, he blamed my bank and said that it was lying.

Obviously, we should have, but i was more concerned with checking ipmi to make sure the server is legitimate, etc, and gave the infomation to my technician to install virtulizor on it. <br>\nI awoke at around 3am my time today, to find out that my service had been suspended at 1am today, due to the cpu being maxed for 4h, which firstly id like to point out that its a dedicated server and why was he looking at my server files (he stated he kvmed in), and secondly the fact that he tried to keep it frozen and not issue a refund is questionable. I went back to sleep.</p> \n\n<p>Additionally, his method of suspending my server is questionable, his suspension method was to unplug the server, rather than disconnecting network, or a safe power down. This suspension method is incredibly alarming, due to the fact that if i was transferring files, or something, it could potentially corrupt something.</p> \n\n<p>I further probed him on this around 12pm today ish and was told to email in to request a login (i had forgotten he sent the new login via discord due to my tiredness this morning). I emailed in with the following '''Hi bitch give me my login info k ty', not exactly professional, but expresses my frustration at his refusal to reset the password because i asked him on discord, even though I had ordered, and paid via a stripe link on discord. He then stated he had disabled the server again, no reason was provided. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925651-743385-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Refusing Refunds</strong></p>\n\n<p>Aspect stated that i had been refunded for this service<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925800-863011-capture.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\n, however after further probing, he revealed that a refund has not been issued, and that he wanted me to make a ticket on his billing panel<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-07-10/1625925807-777879-capture1.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nWhich i dont think i even have a login for, i dont know my password, and frankly i dont want to go onto his site.</p> \n\n<p><strong>Overall Shady Services</strong></p>\n\n<p>The IPs provided for this server are shown as Verizon Residential IPs</p>\n\n<p>(68.132.35.101<br>\n68.132.35.102<br>\n68.132.35.103<br>\n68.132.35.104<br>\n68.132.35.105)<br>\nHowever, he states that they are DC IPs, and it is 'wrong', which i heavily doubt, he has not provided proof of having any Rackspace in the location the server was delivered to me in (NY), and the ips all match up to be Verizion ips, the only proof of him having Rackspace was a picture of a genetic ass looking rack, with 10 year old storage servers in.</p> "}},{"type":"posts","id":"44834","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2022-02-24T14:11:03+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>If someone ran a host paying for 6 nodes and they decided to get an India 🇮🇳 node but all indian VPS providers were overpriced.

(like system administrators know how to setup Pterodactyl Panel)</li>\n<li>have knowledge on how a business role model should be.</li>\n<li>has a support team of people who actually know how to do their job. These people should not get toxic, or mad at people for not knowing how to do things. They should professionally reply to any support tickets. They should at least have care for their consumers. This also means you wouldn't just make your friends staff.</li>\n<li>a proper format on how everything in the hosting provider, including how they would distribute servers and manage staff.</li>\n<li>uses a stable billing panel and does not use something, like a Discord bot, to distribute servers.</li>\n<li>have a proper budget and not be a budget host.</li>\n<li>not do illegal activities.</li>\n<li>have proper terms of services and privacy policy.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>What are unrecommended things that shouldn't be done on a 'good hosting provider'?</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>Overallocated resources are highly discouraged if you want to make a 'good hosting provider'. In fact, it would be a better practice to not overallocate, even on a free hosting provider, and leave some resources free of space. </li>\n<li>Don't give your friends permission or staff, unless they applied. This would be fine if you are making a hosting provider with friends (not encouraged), but don't just give your friends staff, even if they are professional. Let them follow through the normal process of becoming staff, and don't treat them biasedly 'better'. </li>\n<li>Try your best to let your hosting provider only have 1 owner. If there's any drama that comes up, there could be some betrayal and drama that occurs in the future.</li>\n<li>Don't use Dashactyl. It's unstable af.</li>\n<li>Don't punish (ex: mute, kick, temp-ban, ban, etc.) people just because you don't like them. This is completely biased and stupid.</li>\n<li>Don't steal other people's rules (ex: Discord server rules, Terms of Services/Usage, Privacy Policy, etc.) for anything. Don't use a generator to generate these rules, and such. This rule applies for something that isn't your hosting provider. </li>\n<li>Don't make a hosting provider for the sake of popularity. </li>\n<li>Don't tell people that your hosting provider is amazing, and/or perfect. No, it isn't. Every hosting provider has it's own flaws, and advantages. Even though this would be a good marketing strategy, no sh*t... ofc you'll say your hosting provider is good, unless you really know it sucks.</li>\n<li>Don't let people under 13 use your hosting provider.

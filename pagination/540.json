about SalioNodes, CreateX (The top business) is very weird sometimes it almost feels like they are trying to be professional. One time they said they received a mail that it can't continue sent by some \"Anthony\" or smth. That mail was sent 0 minutes ago. They called it \"A Security Message\". It's extremely unlikely that you will see a mail in less than 60 seconds. So it's almost like Anthony and Rexy are the same people. I can't provide proof since the announcements got cleared (All channels remade) But it is like they sent the email themselves. While they act as it's sent by their boss and it professional and all.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that Rexy relies on everyone. To get a VPS, To code for them. I'm regularly getting asked to do things. I just ignore it.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I am aware that he is on his server. But as long he doesn't cause drama there it's fine.</p>\n\n<p>He also was staff at botdash.pro once, he tried to create a clone but then I said he could not. Then he became rude and all. Even saying since he isn't staff anymore (Seer and I demoted him due to drama) that he can create a clone. I am a very calm person. You can do whatever and I don't care. But that Made. Me. Snap.</p>\n\n<p>Also, him being rude to other persons and caps when they do not listen is childish of rexy.</p>\n\n<p>I legit helped out when salionodes was on Drama.gg for Racco, Not for Rexy. But again Rexy is one rude kid and fucked everything up.</p>\n\n<p>Well then that's all I have to say, Reply for questions.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n\n<p>TLRD; Probably faking emails to sound professional, relies on everyone, aware he is on disbots's discord, tried to copy botdash.pro, he's rude when other people don't listen to him</p>\n\n<p>Edit: At one point SalioNodes did illegal operations, By hosting files (Sensitive data) without privacy policy or TOS</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"1899","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2020-09-17T16:05:36+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Holo Hosting LLC is an absolutely terrible company.

Why is it related to this post you might ask? Well, that's because its awfully obvious that Willy was the person who did it.</p>\n\n<p>I am not going to point fingers without any reason, so let me explain myself. So, Willy can be seen using \"bed\" instead of \"bad\" almost all the time. And, the reason why all of my members were banned was \"bed af server\". Proof is in the screen shots below<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/837988253519839292/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/828989597978591252/837988600749752320/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nIf that was not enough, the bot that was used <code>Lawliet Host</code> (our official bot) banned everyone. Guess what? The only 2 people I trusted enough to give the token to were Aypro and Willy. Aypro is still trusted by me and he has no reason to raid as we are in this business together and both are making profits. Plus, he is not dumb enough to only raid the server. If Aypro wanted to ruin the company, he has the access to panel, Discord, all the VPS's, the PayPal, and pretty much everything as an admin. So, that just leaves out Willy as the only suspect for the raid. So, I think we can conclude that Willy raided Lawliet.Host's server.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if that proof was not good enough, he holds grudges against me for making drama.gg threads against him, and not trusting him after he scammed me and did more scummy things.</p>\n\n<p>That is not even the start of all the things Willy has done yet. So, upnext we have him scamming me ~$16 ($10+3+3+ a few cents that I forgot bout) (what a broke ass) and a 16 gig RAM VPS. You did give me a VPS but it was MY VPS. Proof can be found in the screen shots below.<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771714728368013333/835844479004311552/Screenshot_202.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771714728368013333/835844477050421298/Screenshot_201.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771714728368013333/835844479876333578/Screenshot_204.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771714728368013333/817416055135141979/unknown.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\">. <br>\nThen, just scamming me was not enough, so he also scammed my customers.

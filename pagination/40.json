a lot of things I see a lot of hosting companies do and I'm sick of how they are run.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, a lot of them do provide good services and decent hardware, without abusing power and providing quality support to their customers....and some don't ;-; how rude</p>\n\n<p><strong>Support</strong><br>\nStop making your customers go to Discord for support, some of us don't want to be on Discord, or probably don't even know what Discord is. Sure, a lot of your customers may already have a Discord, but that doesn't mean you should make them join your server to get support.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, provide an internal option that doesn't involve your customer going to other platforms and joining groups, servers, or whatever. I can think of a few ways of doing this starting with a community option and another option to talk directly with trained support members.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\"><li>Live Chat and/or Over the phone<br>\nProvide a live chat widget in your panels where your customers manage their servers, this way if they need help they don't need to leave the panel or open a new tab to anywhere else. If you have the money and support members with good English speaking skills(or in other language), you can pay for a phone number that your company can use for your customers to call and get support over the phone.</li></ol>\n\n<p>For live chat, I recommend Crisp for high quality support.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\" start=\"2\"><li>Forums<br>\nIf your host has grown to have a wonderful and an inviting community around it, creating a forums would be a nice additional. This can be a good alternative place for customers to get help, by asking other customers about their experience and for help.</li> </ol>\n\n<p>For a forum software, I recommend selfhosting with something like NodeBB or you can do some research and look around.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal\" start=\"3\"><li>Old Fashison<br>\nAt the least, please, do provide email support for your customers. The company I use to work for seems to of dropped email support, which I wasn't a fan of as I did prefer working with emails instead.</li> </ol>\n\n<p>Make sure the email provider you're using is fast and reliable. If you have the money, I highly recommend FastMail.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Train Your Support Staff</strong><br>\nYou should train your staff members to know the interface of your panel that customers will rely on to create and manager their servers along with features that it offers. You plan to add a new feature and add-on onto the panel, make sure your support staff members are trained for new additional these will bring.</p>\n\n<p>Your staff members should also be at least experience with the services that your host provides, commonly we do see most host in these areas offering servers for Minecraft and Discord bot hosting. So your staff members may need to know how to manage a Minecraft Java/Bedrock server along with experience in Discord bot hosting and keeping up to date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stop Offering So Many Services</strong><br>\nSome companies's supported service list are huge, providing support for games that your staff members probably never heard of and are probably not interested in, let alone they're probably not trained to help customers who are having trouble with it. Actually, most of the games and services on your list might not even get touched by your customers.</p> \n\n<p>Start out with only a couple things that are basic, perfect it, optimize it, and get better at it. Then you can think about adding more services in the future if your customers request it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Don't be Cliche</strong><br>\nIf you plan to or are starting out on creating a new hosting company, please be more unique about your branding, your mission, and services. Make creative with your naming and your logo, maybe hire someone to create a logo for you.</p>\n\n<p>So, do avoid providing hosting for services like Minecraft, Discord Bot Hosting, along with other common option you see. There are already too many hosts that provides these options, so you need to go out there and provide hosting for other options. Maybe provide hosting option for stuff like media servers, matrix, Mastodon (Popular, I think), and more.</p> \n\n<p>Don't use overrated panels like Pterodactyl, Pufferpanel, etc. I'm just sick of seeing them over and over again. Some of the more successful hosts that you do see around today use their own panel and their own code. So, sit down and take the time to create your own panel. Don't know how? Just hire a developer who knows how. It's best that you have a decent backend and a sexy backend for your customers to enjoy and to have a smooth experience. Make sure to do case studies and improve your panel.</p>\n\n<p>On the subject of panels and your website; STOP USING TEMPLATES AND BOOTSTRAP! MAKE IT YOURSELF!!!<br>\nHire a frontend developer, like FalixNodes did with me, to build your landing page and your client panel. Make it unique with your branding.</p> \n\n<p><strong>Be More Prepared</strong><br>\nSpeaking of new companies that now starting up, it's best that you should prepare months in advanced. Make sure that your company provides a Terms of Services, Privacy Policy(Keep GDPR in mind), and other policies as needed.</p> \n\n<p>I've seen some companies go downhill quick because they didn't provide or have the proper documents for their customers to read. You can probably see some examples on drama.</p>\n\n<p>I would take a look here at Iceey's: <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/89-whats-a-gdpr-a-tos\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://drama.gg/d/89-whats-a-gdpr-a-tos</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n<p>Also check out:<br>\n<strong>I don’t want to log in to your website</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23618804/google-facebook-login-ads-web-design-hell\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23618804/google-facebook-login-ads-web-design-hell</a></p>\n<hr>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"49992","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-23T21:14:50+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>This is a rewrite and a reorganized version of my previous thread with more evidence.</p>\n\n<p>For context, OptikServers is owned by J0SH; CortexNodes is owned by samm; Hostaris is owned by both of them.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this thread will be a long one, and may take a long time to read.</p>\n\n<p>I'll be starting with Hostaris.</p>\n<h1>Hostaris</h1>\n<p>First of all, they got banned from <a href=\"https://lowendspirit.com\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://lowendspirit.com</a> which is a red flag when choosing a host.<br>\nSecondly, they're faking company information on companies' house.<br>\nEvidence: <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-23/1677154266-416685-image.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"><br>\nThe date of birth is false, J0SH is 15 and samm is 17 as you'll read later.<br>\nAnd for some reason, Josh's nationality is \"Pakistani\" there.

And he refuses to fix the afk app vulns since even after explaining countless times that it is vulnerable, he does not care. So if you use OptikServers, do not use their afk app and actually just avoid using it. For a more detailed version of this, please check out the old thread: <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/2118\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://drama.gg/d/2118</a></p>\n\n\n<h1>CortexNodes</h1>\n<p>There isn't much about cortexnodes other than the fact that samm owns it and it uses heliactyl, and it also had a RCE vuln exposed which has now been fixed since I reported it. CortexNodes has been included in this thread solely because it's owned by samm and to tell people not to use it since they'd probably be risking their personal data.</p>\n\n<p>Now coming onto J0SH and samm themselves.</p>\n\n<h1>Samm</h1>\n<p>To start off, samm's one heck of a racist person.

This has been a ride, and I’m here to expose the truth behind what happens privately, and well, publicly.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, the fraud, or more specifically, tax fraud. While I was still at Galactiq, I learned many things, but this one just surprised me. He, as a 17 year old, is funneling money from Galactiq Hosting’s clients into his parent’s paypal. This is just obsurd. And not for the reasons you think, that alone is not worth explaining, but I’m guessing you know why he’s funneling it to his parent’s paypal…oh you guessed right, to avoid paypal’s taxes. Furthermore he claims he didn’t need to register the business as legal, then after a few more times of asking him, he cited a “Sole Proprietorship'' (according to Stripe of all things)<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676753420-1863-screenshot-20221128-102703-f3912.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Furthering on this “Sole Proprietorship” he says that there’s nothing wrong with running an unregistered business…as long as you meet some requirements, which he does not (and can’t, as he’s underage). He also says that his income is under the IRS threshold, which yes it is, but I once again call to him not having a Business Tax ID, a Personal Bank account, and the fact that he’s underage. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676753465-85800-unknown-abf52.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Here’s another screenshot showing that he has not registered (albeit it this is quite old, but he’s still not done it, go, check if you don’t believe me.)<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676753485-864189-unknown-c9624.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676753738-574050-img-2366-b2687.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676753753-254931-img-2365-1cd53.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Here he says he doesn’t need to file taxes, citing that sole proprietorship again (WHICH ONCE AGAIN, is according to Stripe)</p>\n\n<p>Now, that’s the main part of the actual tax fraud, but that is still fraud (and unregistered with no legal material other than a ToS and PP). Furthermore, you can see how defensive he gets when questioned about the before mentioned taxes, and tax ID. And yes, he does indeed threaten to sue a company for just dming him.</p> \n\n<p>You can dial him at +1 (616) 262-9380 or +1 (616) 301-2246 (however we don’t encourage it, and no, we’ll not be liable if you destroy his phone)</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676753776-602289-img-2367-0ee99.jpg\" title=\"\"><br>\nNow, about the Theft, well not really theft, but you’ll see what I mean. I’ll give a bit of backstory on this one. I joined CrewCraft in late 2021 and all was well, we had quite a few clients, however that’s where the issues began. Summer 2022, we started losing a lot of clients (something which I pointed out in our Group Chat, but he basically ignored it). During the same Summer, we were almost out of money, and we agreed to host all of our current customers on the server which I hosted in my area, without so much as asking for a penny, as I was expecting to get a 30% share when we went on the market (oh and no, the 12 USD i got paid throughout the 4-ish months isn’t payment). This went on for about 4 months, with me nagging Damien/Pengu/Max about it almost every single day (and him not doing anything). After those 4 months, we finally had a second server, but it was too late, we had lost around 15-20 of our customers. After a few months of CrewCraft barely living, Max/Damien/Pengu alongside Jeroen and Manu (the 2 founders of another small hosting company) decided to merge. I was not informed of this until it randomly came up in a convo, and it wasn’t even to inform me, it was about a name for the company. Now, this is where it basically went to hell. Very little progress was being made on attracting customers, our (well mostly theirs, this is the part where I started being phased out) main focus was to gain more servers, because Damien/Max was expecting 10USD/d of ads to bring us that many customers (he’s not said that directly, however it was obvious he thought ads would bring us hundreds of clients within a few days at most). After I started calling him out on both the negligence to get customers and the dumb server focus, I was “fired” (if you can even call it that) from Galactiq. Damien/Max cited disrespect, and I urge him to provide evidence of this when he finds this lovely thread.</p>\n\n<p>Now, after this Traven (whom will give his POV below) contacted me with a link of Galactiq’s blog regarding free servers, then I gave him some screenshots and he proceeded to dm max. He then proceeded to dm me and tried guilt-tripping me into thinking that my screenshots from the “confidential” chats (which didn’t include anything “confidential”) are supposed to be secret, which I do agree on to some level, but said screenshots did not include anything business-breaking as he tried to make it seem.</p> \n\n<p>I want to bring your attention back to the 4 months of unpaid server hosting (which cost me around 80 USD worth of electricity and internet). This is one of the biggest hurdles for me atleast, with him. And before you say anything, no I did not say I would keep it running free-of-cost. During these 4 months, CrewCraft was kept alive by only me, no matter what he says he could have done. He then proceeds to phase me out, making it seem like I was only a resource that kept quiet/didn’t know about his shenanigans &amp; gave him hardware in which he did indeed succeed.</p> \n\n<p>Now, he may say he “defended” me for months from Jeroen and Manu, however I did not receive anything about him defending me, or atleast asking me to act professional (which they themselves did overnight, without me knowing, which resulted in them making me seem like the bad guy).</p>\n\n<p>And finally for the backstory, after I was “fired” I was banned from all their Discords and removed from their records (even their “story” blog, that says something)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676753811-952675-img-2362-25ee8.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Now I’ll give another screenshot. In this one he lies (as usual by now) and says he told me everything in this business was a risk, when he fetches me a message of that (and me seeing it, I can’t be blamed for an important message in a meme filled chat, which oh yeah, that’s what most of the “confidential” chat was, don’t believe me? Oh well, ask him to send screenshots of the chat from before September 2022, hell maybe even from before November 2022. He says there haven’t been clients on my system for a long time….that was the case for most of our servers, hell it still is, ask him about it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676753835-742278-img-2361-4f097.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Stage 2:</p> \n\n<p>The Uncovering</p>\n\n<p>Hi, im Sam, former “employee” of CrewCraft before it turned into Galactiq<br>\nPretty Much the only reason i was “hired” by Damien was the fact that i'm pretty good at covering up holes on websites and managing servers in general as a system administrator, to a certain point, i started suspecting Damien was doing shady stuff like buying a lot of nodes for no reason at all (at the time we had like 6-5 customers and he was already buying 6-5 used machines he could find on amazon), so i played along until Yeetster had a amazing idea to just “do a little trolling” and do no formal statement saying why i was fired, so yeah, damien and him locked me out of the nodes and that's the way i got fired, damien said “cope man, cope” and that's about it, but this is not my point, it's just some background story so you get on the context.</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago Yeetster realized that Damien was doing crapsh*t so he tried pointing it out to him, resulting in again, first a removal from all accounts AND THEN after 1-2 hours a statement explaining what happened etc.</p>\n\n\n<p>Allegations:<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676754024-696133-1.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nTo get this screenshots, we got access to their panel because damien apparently forgot to close his billing panel properly and the .env was exposed to everyone (yes, you can imagine the level of security their website has)<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676754061-958852-2.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n(password revoked now, but you get the idea if you are familiar with pterodactyl DB’s)</p>\n\n<p>I love the fact he says no billing information was accessed when in reality, just by that major security flaw we got access to almost the entire hosting service.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676754091-460920-3.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n(paypal API proof for damien’s reference)</p>\n\n\n<p>In general, as you may have seen from screenshots above, Damien is not a person to trust for your personal data, passwords or even your billing details, but this is not it, the website has such security that it can literally be defaced by a 5 year old. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676754165-282032-4.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nHe doesn’t even have an proper email server set up on his panel 🤣<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2023-02-18/1676754174-869351-5.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nSo yes, if someone needs more proof about this claims, i can provide you with demonstration data to prove the fact this website is insecure on dm’s at VolleierYouKnow#6004.</p>\n\n<p>Their discord is: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/MEMzSkeTTc\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.gg/MEMzSkeTTc</a></p> \n\n<p>I would be glad if you ask any question to the owner to hear his answers, our team has sent over 25 questions and all we got was excuses.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}},{"type":"posts","id":"49783","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-17T04:42:47+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><strong>EasyMC</strong> (<a href=\"https://easyminecrafthosting.com\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://easyminecrafthosting.com</a>) use IONOS VPS for the game panel, whmcs and phpmyadmin.<br>\nThis host is a famous spanish -

A ex-staff member of Windows Support Community, I joined just today to talk about WSC (Windows Support Community), they have really bad owners even sabotaging an another server called Windows 11 Community which I am no longer co-owner of after that server got deleted.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to mention what they've pulled that got Windows 11 Community deleted.</p>\n\n<p>First Issue - One of the admins of WSC pretty much spit in one of the W11C staff's face because an another bot (Tickets) has a similar function. Which they wanted replaced, we got pissed and straight up called them out. The staff member was a developer hence why they got pissed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/861142164074135613/861151785188458496/Screenshot_20210704-004922.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855562077128359947/1058633190278971464/Screenshot_20221231-012338_Discord.jpg\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 2</a></p>\n\n<p>Second Issue - The same admin posted an invite to their server, Windows Support Community back when it was Windows Community which reached 50 members in a week because they stole members from our server. Here's the thing, he wasn't a booster and staff aren't allowed to post their own ad in the booster promo channel. When he did this, people started going to this server so we called the dude out.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/861142164074135613/861152534605594644/Screenshot_20210704-003446.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/861142164074135613/861145693200056360/Screenshot_20210704-002525.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 2 (The owner inviting the staff member)</a></p>\n\n<p>Screenshot 2 of Issue #1 is also a role of this issue.</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards, after the server got banned. More issues started appearing, like they've been redistributing modified copies of Windows 10 and they've been getting bad staff, one of the staff of WSC became a co-owner in 2 months when I was Junior Moderator for 2 months before I got banned.</p>\n\n<p>First Issue - Wingamo Devs and their modded copies of Windows. Long story short, My ideas kept getting stolen and arguments kept happening which got me banned for no reason.</p>\n\n<p>Second Issue (Part 1) - Members being toxic, especially the owners and Windows 7 users. Literally, I was doing my job moderating and some dude was telling others to downgrade to Windows 7 because Windows 10/11 sucks and we kept saying stop and they wouldn't stop so I had to ban that member.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/996112715024175104/Screenshot_2022-07-11-20-56-02-17_572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 1 (Taken by a friend of mine)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/997581860613918762/Screenshot_2022-07-15-22-14-02-38_572064f74bd5f9fa804b05334aa4f912.jpg\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 2 (Taken by the same person)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/997909990151041024/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972425343329783898/997911445025071224/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">Screenshot 4 (I had to find a way to tell the person to stop)</a></p>\n\n<p>NOTE: The first 2 screenshots are taken by TheDieMargus, the arabic name is the troublemaker.</p>\n\n<p>Second Issue (Part 2) - More users keep telling others to use older software which isn't safe for your computer and could possibly have a virus.

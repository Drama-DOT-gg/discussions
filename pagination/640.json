He mentioned his Minecraft server, when I looked at its host I found out that it was Fallout Hosting (<a href=\"https://fallout-hosting.com/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://fallout-hosting.com/</a>). After looking at the plans, I thought its $1/GB of RAM as they NEVER mentioned wheather its RAM or disk that they are offering for $1/GB. They did not even mention the amount of RAM or the amount of CPU cores that they provide you with. After talking to my customer a bit more, I found out that it was $1/GB of disk (<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826128126479564810/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826128126479564810/unknown.png</a>). Those guys are literally scamming kids with $1/GB of disk for a Minecraft server. Its one of the most ridiculous things I have stumbled upon in a while. I am not really sure if it fits in here though. Most of the names have been cut out from the screenies for the privacy of our customers. All the proof that I did not give in screenies can be found on their website (<a href=\"https://fallout-hosting.com/minecraft-hosting\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://fallout-hosting.com/minecraft-hosting</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Turns out, they offer $1/GB of RAM.

Also one of their current staff members has a DNDW role in the winterhoax discord. Jex also likes to bring up my past and other winterhoaxes that I have proven wrong like me using a website builder for someone, but he is yet to use that brain of his to see the evidence I showed him.

After making a 1gb ram server with 2 gb disk and 1 core, the moment I did /tps, the tps was 6.86, 14.46, 17.48 tps for the first time and second time 1.0, 4.1, 8.73. I was shocked. I tried all the Jars like Spigot, Paper, Vanilla and fabric but all very bad tps. I though they were using either Premium or Deluxe on Velocity but it looks like they are using a Budget Plan [According to its Performance]. I am pretty sure I will get Demoted after this. Also the CEO's are very weird when I talked to them. One of the CEO's said that they can crack Hetnzer and use it for about 1 month and then when the time is up they transfer data to a new Cracked Hetnzer node [That does not mean they are doing that mind you].</p>\n\n<p>More Case on CatServices: <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/508-catservices\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://drama.gg/d/508-catservices</a> [On Bad Staff Team by MyBoySmile / BabyAces]</p>\n\n<p>Also:<br>\nI don't aim to spread hate on CatServices and please don't spread hate.

Find a hoaxable host</h2>\n<p>Disboard is a great website to search for free hoaxable hosts!<br>\nJust use the <a href=\"https://disboard.org/servers/tag/free-hosting\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\"><strong>FREE-HOSTING</strong> tag </a> or <a href=\"https://disboard.org/search?keyword=free+hosting\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">search for free hosting</a><br>\nAs you see, lots of hostings are advertised there!<br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lrCudED.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"Img01\"></p>\n\n<p>We recommend hoaxing little hostings that aren't a registered company, normally with these errors:</p>\n<ul><li>Freenom domain (.tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq)</li>\n<li>No TOS and PP</li>\n<li>Bad Uptime</li>\n<li>Datalosess</li>\n<li>Underage Owner<br>\n(You can hoax any host but with a valid reason)</li></ul>\n\n<h2>2 - Recollect information</h2>\n<p>Join the discord server and start recollecting info.<br>\nWe recommend having at least this information:</p>\n<ul><li>Domain Information</li>\n<li>Node Information</li>\n<li>Discord Server Invite (Better disboard URL if they delete your invite)</li></ul>\n\n<h2>3 - Start a drama.gg thread</h2>\n<p>You can guide you on this step with one of my hoax, <a href=\"https://drama.gg/d/392-nexusnodestk-90-downtime-no-tos-privacy-policy-using-tk-domain\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">NexusNodes</a></p>\n\n<h2>4 -

and one of my friends ordered colocation for a 1U server located in the UK paid for a price matched of $29 (paid yearly). They also they agreed to cover 50% of the shipping cost as it was pretty expensive shipping from Canada to UK aswell also to pay the twise debit card fees (which was 10$) so we paid 390$ on April 4th, 2021.<br>\nNote: before paying for the colocation the administrator agreed to offer a refund within 31 days if we were not satisfied with the service also while covering the return shipping fee. Do note that at this point we never really got the server fully setup since we were waiting for parts and we had to refund an nvme riser due to it being broken, but after we got it all working it was a while later and that was not what I was looking for so I raised a refund request on the 1st of May and to date which is 18 June 2021 we have not received a refund yet.

We didn’t receive the dedi even after a week which was past the timeframe that was given to us, so we again raised a refund request which they said was okay. From what eraters told me, they showed the proof that CPU was what was holding up the order along with proof of it. Then eraters said it was fine but then, as usual, we still receive it. We once again, we forwarded the refund request but they said they wont be refunding the setup fee which we said was fine even though we didn’t receive it in the first place. I would also like to add in 2 things, for both transactions (colocation and the dedi), I paid with transfer wise, and for the dedi payment, at first I was given a UK payment page which didn’t work as my card is a US card, so we moved on to transferwise, which we probably tried 3 or 4 of the administrator and System 413’s bank accounts to get the payment to go through.<br>\nI would show screenshots of this, however a lot of the chat has personal info in it.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005945-510757-262496f9-6d54-4890-b427-3ddf011260cc.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-06-18/1624005953-95647-9856d7dd-b422-4a2f-8a1f-5d47eaa86e8b.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n"}},{"type":"posts","id":"32099","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-10-25T14:39:36+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>WolfLover aka Wolfo in Discord is the unpacientest, stingy and rudest person on earth.

HostNexxus, LLC (as per their twitter) is \"A Low cost, Easy to Maintain Discord Bot &amp; Shared Website Hosting Company.\" According to their most recent Discord announcement they have been around since August of 2020. This is credible by looking through their Discord.</p>\n\n<p>Let me introduce myself. Hi! I'm Drake, otherwise known as DaDrake#7921. While I believe everyone has a chance to correct themselves, I don't believe that it should be at the cost of others. In this case, let me introduce you into why I believe HostNexxus, LLC is \"unprofessional\", committing \"Illegal Activites\", and whatever else I set the topic tag as.</p>\n\n<p>Unprofessional &amp; Illegal Activites. Upon joining their Discord I was greeted with an interesting overview. <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-10/1633900218-360680-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\nNothing out of the ordinary, but it looks respectful at best. They do happen to do Discord tickets, which is scummy, but otherwise typical of a Discord host. I digress, onto the more pressing matters.<br>\nI asked about their LLC status, (NV20201890838) and why the status had changed from \"active\" to \"default\". I was met with abusive comments from their partner Itszylus and from one of their staff members Colin. Colin who had repeatedly informed me that he was on his way out after submitting a 2 week notice, kept telling me to ignore it and stated that it was just an error. I kept asking about it, only to be met with a chat clearing and nothing happening. (If you did not know, in the state of Nevada where HostNexxus, LLC happens to be registered, if your LLC status turns to default, it means you didn't pay the state and your LLC is now invalid, and as a result, you must pay late fees, plus registration, plus submitting some other documents to reinstate your LLC.) Essentially, continuing to state that you hold an LLC, when you actually don't, seems a bit fraud-y (wouldn't you agree?).</p>\n\n<p>Recently, HostNexxus, LLC happened to have a 16 hour downtime, and when pressed about this matter, <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-10/1633900755-691748-image.png\" title=\"\"> (downtime as posted in #status-announcements) the chat was cleared in both their #general and #status-announcements. It seems like they don't want to answer our questions because they don't know what they are doing. Here is the only response one of my partners received about the downtime. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-10/1633900877-167160-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>So, what do you guys think? I would consider this to be a fraudulent operation, ran by kids who don't understand what they are doing. As of now, I'm banned from their Discord but I would love to see the community go in and ask the same questions I have asked (mainly about falsely portraying as an LLC) and at least get them shut down. <img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-10-10/1633900992-592966-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Their discord can be found at <a href=\"https://www.hostnexxus.com/discord\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.hostnexxus.com/discord</a>.</p> \n\n"}},{"type":"posts","id":"26381","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-08-31T16:09:43+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>I decided to make this post due there a guy who made hosting, who uses google cloud platform which only alive for about a month.

This is a bit of a paid host tier list, made one before but i'm trying to make it better. If you have any suggestions on what to add please respond to the thread, thanks.</p>\n\n<p>Minecraft Server Hosting tier list.</p> \n\n<p>Note, this was completely unbias. I paid for this out of my own pocket. This whole review is 100% honest.</p>\n\n<p>WitherHosting - <a href=\"https://witherhosting.com\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://witherhosting.com</a></p>\n\n<p>CPU: Intel Core i9 10900K</p>\n\n<p>CPU Performance: 104CPS, that's really good! - Note, this was measured with Chunky, a chunk rendering plugin. It tests CPU Performance.</p>\n\n<p>Memory: WitherHosting uses DDR4 3200MHz to push the i9 10900K well with your server. - Note, this is your server cache you can say, what runs it as well as it can.</p>\n\n<p>Storage: 100% NVMe storage to provide great performance, my server started in 1 second! - Note, this is what holds your server. With the fast storage your server is lighting fast.</p>\n\n<p>Locations: WitherHosting has a plethora of locations, here they are! <a href=\"https://witherhosting.com/locations.html\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://witherhosting.com/locations.html</a> - Note, this is where the host has servers. So where your minecraft server can get located.</p>\n\n<p>Final: WitherHosting has great performance on a budget with 1$ per GB ram and cheap cores to go with your server, I would use it! Here is a promocode for everyone who read this far.

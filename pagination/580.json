' If they pass you the ip of the machine or domain go to '<a href=\"https://check-host.net/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://check-host.net/</a>' go to info and scan the website and see if the website is hosted in google or other company, if it say cloudflare this method will not work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WEB HOSTING</strong><br>\nI will remind you of something so that you do not get confused by the hosting that say they offer 'unlimited space' it is not that it is a scam, just keep in mind that it is impossible to provide unlimited space and ram since logically it is not possible, I recommend you ask what is the ram limit that your web page can use, also keep in mind that a page hosted on a hosting is not a super heavy business page, since if it would a company website it will be hosted on a vps and not in a web hosting of '5 usd', Also whenever you buy, ask if the server is shared or dedicated, shared servers usually cost less than 5 usd for a lot of space, whereas dedicated ones cost more than 15 usd (In some hostings)</p>\n\n<p><strong>DO NOT MOVE FROM THE PLATFORM</strong><br>\nIf they are selling you a hosting for discord speak for discord, if they tell you to go to telegram or related apps tell them no, since discord will not be responsible if he is a scammer, I also recommend you always record the conversation to be able to Report on these types of forums to prevent others from being scammed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PAYMENT</strong><br>\nRemember that if the owner of the hosting asks you to pay him for 'Payment of friends and family' and he scams you, paypal will not be responsible if he scams you, and the guarantee og customer protection policy will not be activated, this is the same with bitcoins and cryptos,  remember that cryptocurrencies do not have a backup bank for them so you will not have anyone to ask for your money back. Always pay by PayPal 'Payment of services'</p>\n\n<p><strong>DATA LEAK</strong><br>\nYou have to take into account that you have to be careful where you buy your website or vps, since the owner of the services will be able to see what you do inside and sometimes they abuse and can steal information from your users, Always buy in hostings that are verified, or that you see that they are trustworthy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Take care of yourself 🙂</strong> <br>\nI hope it helps you</p> \n\n"}},{"type":"posts","id":"14365","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-05-12T10:13:34+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Hello</p> \n\n<p>First of all let me introduce my self i recently started a small dev company and a free host with a friend. as it was my first time starting Businesses i made some Mistakes, the mistakes am gonna mention weren't totally mine but am here today to talk about me .</p>\n\n<p>i have recently aquired the information that a thread is releasing about me here soon , so i thought, explaining myself before it comes out would be better, am not really sure what the thread is gonna talk about but here's the stuff i think i did wrong and how i solved them.</p>\n\n<p>First of all Lets talk about the host (Genix-Host):<br>\nin genix me and the other founder did 2 mistakes : <br>\n1- The information about the node in the channel was wrong , i didn't really notice the mistake in the channel, as  its a simple thing and there was no need re-checking it  : the node had 10gb of ram <br>\nwhile in the node information channel it said it was 15GB this got fixed the moment i noticed it.<br>\n2- The rules: The rules were copied from another server , i didn't type the rules the other founder did, and it turned out later he didn't type it either he copied them from sway services, the minute i  saw this i removed the old rules and added new one that i typed , he's explaining was \"it was temporary\",</p>\n\n<p>which will bring us to the second sections my dev company its called atom dev and it also had 2 mistakes:</p>\n\n<p>1- The Rules , this was before i realised genix rules were copied, so i took genix rules and used them for my dev company (atom development) , when the original owner of the rules informedme that it was his rules  i changed them right after i changed genix rules.</p>\n\n<p>2- Reselling a theme from ptero-dev : i managed to get a theme from someone for free , the person said he made it but i was sure it was from ptero-dev , i checked ptero-dev rules (they didnt have a tos ) and i found nothing that mentions reselling or getting it for free wasn't allowed so i put it for sale for a cheaper price, when the owners of the theme informed that they weren't okey with their themes getting resold, we took it down (we didn't take it down quitely we had a small argument but the argument was after we took it down)</p>\n\n<p>another small thing for atom development (my dev ): we were going to start with  3 founders but when the 3rd founder was giving stolen templates and we suspected him with other stuff we demoted him this was before we started working on anything or do anything.</p>\n\n<p>Again i apologize, i am not even sure if the thread is coming out but i wanted to explain my self anyways , if the thread comes out and i missed some stuff i will reply to that thread with explanation</p>\n\n<p>I hope you guys understand this and forgive me and my colleagues.</p>\n\n<p>ill answer any questions left below</p> "}},{"type":"posts","id":"14956","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-05-15T07:03:04+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>So what happend was, blackkitten started to be really mean to sappy and literally made sappy cry.

After three days of being a investor on Raided Hosting helping out my friends. Then after ViaHost came alive and was dying a lot I came on their server and checked them out. They were absolutely  horrible, really i'm not joking - theres even a winterhoax thread about it. A few days later when SceuGe joined, everything started growing on Via because he was giving free VPSs (16GB ram). Then I was a developer + administrator of it just to help them out a bit and tell them what they are doing wrong. When I was a developer on Via I was developing some sites like the main page and trying to make a client panel, when we announced it to the whole server that we are going to use it on ScueGe's nodes to host it on, ScueGe'd was so bothered about it that he literally copy all the files and use it for Host Horizon then shutting down the VPSs and the host had to be shut down.</p>\n\n<p>At Horizon Hosting<br>\nHere we at, at Host Horizon. ScecuGe the main owner of Horizon seen my work on the other discord hosting guild, and wanted me to be staff. I did not want to participate with them as he didn't give me my files plus coding that I did on the other vpss for sites. After him keep saying for me to be a investor / executive, I said \"NO\" because since he is investing other hosts why not do it for yourself then??. It makes no sense at all. Why would he want me to invest his host that has a stolen src on their \"not ready site\". SceuGe said why do you not want to be part of the team.. I said it's because I do not trust you anymore. When I didn't want to be investing him and his host. A few days later, I had nothing to do except from maybe checking out some other hosts, and the only host I could check out was Horizon so I DM'd SecuGe'd again and said can I apply for the team this time? And he gave me the invite and gave me the roles (management and CFO &amp; COO) straight away?? Still again why would anyone do that. It had 50 members so I was like I think I could help this host out by designing the channels and creating more information about the host.</p>\n\n<p>Working at.. Host Horizon?<br>\nOkay yes, I still had nothing to do but the guy was pretty nice to me and I was the investor of their host.<br>\nI bought them a starter node (De1) which had 30GB of RAM from hetzner. His management team was very happy and the userbase was happy about it to - but the userbase didn't know about that it would be coming to a bad end. A few days later, just when I am offline - I've been pinged and notified to do many things that I didn't get paid for. They kept asking me to pay to daft (Co Owner of the host) when he said he is gonna pay me.</p>\n\n<p>Heres Daft trying to force me to invest him something: <a href=\"http://prntscr.com/v7c5l1\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">http://prntscr.com/v7c5l1</a><br>\nHere's Daft trying to force me to give him money for a promotion?? : <a href=\"http://prntscr.com/v7c7z0\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">http://prntscr.com/v7c7z0</a></p> \n\n<p>I also have been told to put the root password (ssh access) in the executive-only category section multiple times, so I did since I got it for the owners to invest. After me not noticing, they have figured out the password for my hetzner account. (the ssh password was the same as the hetzner cp acc). Guess what they did, shutting down the hetzner nodes and fake deleting the servers. Even though i didnt have access to the admin panel..

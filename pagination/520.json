So, while browsing for good and cheap dedicated server providers I stumbled upon VelocityNode.net (They are not the scammers.). It turns out that they only sold VPS's, I went to their support Discord server and saw the status of one of the employees, it said \"Hey You! Yes, You. Are You Looking For A Discord Bot To Call Your Own? Look No Further! Prices: $10-$15. Free Hosting Included!\". After looking at the \"Free Hosting Included\" part, I was kinda curious as to what they had to offer. It was a free plan with about 200 MB of RAM, 1 GB of disk (<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119700504510484/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119700504510484/unknown.png</a>). Its shitty but free. I asked to see her other plans if she was selling hosting, she linked me to her Discord server (<a href=\"https://discord.gg/d7AvdVtf\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.gg/d7AvdVtf</a>). While going through the plans, I found this \"- Master Plan: Unlimited Ram, Unlimited CPU, Unlimited Disk And 5 Servers! - $10\". Obviously, it looked suspicious as heck, I asked her about it and she did say that it was indeed unlimited resources (<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119774487838730/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119774487838730/unknown.png</a>). Still thinking its a scam, I asked for her terms of service, she linked me to a channel in her Discord. This is what it said:<br>\n\"BrehHost TOS<br>\nWelcome To BrehHost!</p>\n\n<p>Here At BrehHost We Follow The Same TOS As Discord Has! If You Follow Discord's TOS You Follow Ours. Faillure To Follow The TOS In Any Way Will Result In A Ban Or Kick Based Off The Severity! We Have The Right To Suspend Your Services At Any Time If You Break The TOS Or Leave The Server!</p>\n\n<p>Discord Tos: <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://discord.com/terms</a>\"</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, you read it right. They are a god damn hosting company and are claiming that they use the same TOS as Discord. Upon asking for the privacy policy, they responded with \"i'm still working on it as of now\" (ss for both temrs and privacy policy <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119854825668668/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119854825668668/unknown.png</a>). I thought I would question her further tommorow then make the post. The next day comes and I asked her about her dedi. She responded with \"I don't hhave a dedi XD. But it has 4GB ram, 30GB SSD And 1 IP. I Pai $2 a month for it...\" (<a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119929135628318/unknown.png\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755835147412308120/826119929135628318/unknown.png</a>). So, you telling me that you offering unlimited RAM and disk but you only got 4 GB of RAM and 30 GB of SSD disk?

I've listed a few charges below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charges</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Using Freenom</li>\n<li>Using Contabo (This is not a crime, but considering the \"DDoS shield\" was claimed)</li>\n<li>Falsing Information</li>\n<li>Blackmailing</li>\n<li>Having no Legal TOS</li>\n<li>Exitscamming</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Using freenom, I'd not need to explain this to much claims to have a good host whilst using a free .cf domain from Freenom. You can get those days a .xyz for maybe 1$ at Namecheap.</p> \n\n<p>Using Contabo whilst claiming they do have premium servers, we would not consider Contabo to be premium those days for enterprise users who are trusting a host to keep their sh*t alive.  You would need a sustainable source for your servers to be hosted on.</p> \n\n<p>Falsing information, he made a whole thread about a company called NYMetroCloud who he was claiming to are scammers, having no ToS, walking around with a stolen logo whilst the staff was linking all information required to this (e.g. TOS, Privacy Policy) This is a very young child who is trying with his pocketmoney to start a host, seems familiar doesn't it? After we did expose him for his charges he deleted the thread and instantly friended us on discord with saying \"Am sorry\". The kid does seems like he is 12 years old and firstly decided to apply at us for wanting to be a \"developer / system administrator\". When we said we did not search any he started to become toxic and then the thread was made of us \"stealing logo's\". <br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-23/1619220678-375267-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>He was on the same time blackmailing us for \"having the stolen logo\" as mentioned before, and also threatend to made a post on Drama.gg if we did not unban him for advertisements for his own hosts.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-23/1619220854-702982-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-04-23/1619220928-51582-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Whilst he claimed us to have no ToS, he has only provided us with a simple copied staff rules from another hosting company + discord rules who were claimed to be legal rules.</p>\n\n<p>After this he instantly put his domain / panel offline, what we do call a simple exit scam when it get's to hard to defend yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Now I do not want you guys to attack his host, let this be a lesson for the kid himself. I know the true power of drama.gg, but this is not needed today.</p> \n\n<p>Stay safe buds.</p>\n\n\n\n"}},{"type":"posts","id":"17720","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-05-31T20:42:16+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Hey,</p>\n\n<p>Started a partnership with coresrv the other day.<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-31/1622493705-29998-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-31/1622493715-972378-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-31/1622493724-781746-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2021-05-31/1622493735-309323-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n"}},{"type":"posts","id":"19362","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-06-19T18:25:21+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>Lmao, I wanna see what you say.</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"61","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2020-07-18T13:15:38+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-18/1595078071-505084-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-18/1595078076-334187-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-18/1595078086-837682-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-18/1595078097-213181-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-18/1595078103-185175-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-18/1595078108-764082-image.png\" title=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-18/1595078114-757448-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>also trying to get him to add a fake iban to get servers</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://winterhoax.com/assets/files/2020-07-18/1595078129-223824-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>His discord ID is 688658192523198581</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"19512","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2021-06-24T01:55:57+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>I got banned from the official rainbow six siege discord and appealed in the ban server and I instantly got banned from the ban server because they have biased mods and the mod that bans you looks at your appeal.

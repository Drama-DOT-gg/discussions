free trials, you need to provide: (any of the following)</p>\n<ul><li>Actual invoice of the host using free trial</li>\n<li>The owner own words<br>\n<strong>Reverse IP lookup only tells the server provider or even load balancer/proxy provider, this cannot be use as free trials evidence. Using Cloudflare doesn't mean you suck, drama.gg use it as well (replying on the recent thread)</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>Secondly, you need to explain which terms of cloud provider did the host break. I have read Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud (GCP) &amp; Azure free trials terms and none of them mention you cannot resell their service nor providing free service to other.<br>\n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/free/terms/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://aws.amazon.com/free/terms/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/terms/free-trial\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://cloud.google.com/terms/free-trial</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0044p/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0044p/</a></p>\n\n<p>I do agree using free trials can be unprofessional, but it's never illegal unless you do carding and other stuff (talk is easy, providing evidence is hard, so make sure you provide evidence before making a conclusion). One of the common unprofessional is data loss (which you guys a good job on Badsk thread), but by saying unprofessional doesn't mean some mod ban/kick you out from the server and you should cry at drama.gg (Please be professional at drama.gg).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technically reselling cloud service is not illegal</strong>, it's more like a value-added service (like you provide support, installation and setup), therefore there's nothing to expose over there, drama.gg can be a better place of exposing better things like actual scam instead of just free trials, the free trials topic just never got off.</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"40931","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-17T23:32:00+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p><img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-17/1642462465-125916-are-you-looking-to-get-scammed-or-robbed-1.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n\n<p>Discord GT: TMKC#2536</p>"}},{"type":"posts","id":"40714","attributes":{"number":1,"createdAt":"2022-01-15T18:28:34+00:00","contentType":"comment","contentHtml":"<p>HalexNodes.net is very bad host, lemme show you why:</p> \n\n<p>Abusing Hetzner?<br>\n<img src=\"https://drama.gg/assets/files/2022-01-15/1642271233-843610-image.png\" title=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Or.. maybe..

has done with all of his customer data he has lost over the months, he has lost over thousands of customer data adn went to abuse big corporations, now im not saying im bad, but im my opinion i dont think i went as far as him, i was very new to hosting when i was abusing, and i of course had no source of income, but this thread isnt about me it is about the scum Plexed/Badsk himself.

He asked if he could help me with the new host I'm making. I agreed and let him become management, I later received a dm from one of my friends who informed me that CloudBud was \"immature\". My experience with CloudBud for the last 3 hours went against that, but I removed his management role and I went into his connected social media accounts. After searching for a while on drama.gg, I found his Tikok which is very <em>cringe</em> (<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\" rel=\" nofollow ugc\">https://www.tiktok.com/</a>@[Some content here may have been removed by the Drama.gg team]?lang=en). [Update: He has deleted all his videos from his tiktok]. He posts several videos about him moving his camera over the announcements he makes on his discord server. I asked him about it and he claimed it was his brother, and his brother had his discord login info. I was skeptical, but I went along with it. One thing I found on his tiktok was that he was struggling to eat a single taki (JUST ONE). I left his tiktok which has now been deleted (all the videos have) which is very sus. I spent a while going through his twitter and found a bunch of weird stuff. But before I get into that, heres some more stuff. Before this whole thing, I asked him if he was a Roblox game developer, he said \"I don't, but my brother does\". I then went to his twitter and found several tweets going to games on roblox asking \"Can I develop for you\". Then, I asked him to invite me to Poly Hosting server (his host I think). He replied saying he deleted it/doesn't exist. I found the discord widget on his twitch and it showed people online on his server. I showed him that and he said, \"why do you want to join\". That was a big red flag. Now I'll show pictures and everything to let you know, (<strong><em>Btw, hes a furry</em></strong>)<br>\n<em>LINKS:</em> [Edit: He fucking deleted the twitter off his discord profile, I still have

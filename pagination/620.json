Please beware of him. Here are my thoughts:</strong></p>\n\n<p>So for about a month ago, I joined SkyCastle Hosting. I am a developer of the host. But then we got hoaxed and a guy called Rihard took away all our VPSs. Then I created RedGate Hosting. I thought I should give Rihard a chance, so he came back to help working at RedGate. Today, he did something hilarious. He raided Ectrix Host's bot and the bot went crazy, deleting everything. He even took away his VPSs for the second time for no reason. At last he said he didn't do it and he is very rude and forced me to ban him from RedGate forever.<br>\nI was thinking why he even did that? I just want to make a host with my friends including him and make some money.
